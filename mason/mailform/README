This component deals with the ubiquious HTML2Mail problem: A web user fills
out a form (giving away details and request information) and submits the form.
The component will analyse the fields, do some sanity checks and fires off
an email.

This component also does sanity checks on the fields, provides indirection
and defaults and some template mechanism for more flexibility. All is controlled
via fields in the form.

See the mailform.mc component itself for more documentation.
