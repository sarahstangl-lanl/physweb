<h4>Editing your own entry</h4>

You can edit some parts of your own directory entry through your profile page.
First, find your name in the directory, and click on it to display your profile.
Now you need to log in to the web site. Click the "Log in" link at the lower left of the page. Enter your University of Minnesota Internet ID and password, and click the "Login" button. You should be taken back to your directory profile page, but a new link, "Edit this profile" will be present. You can click on this link to change your email address, home address and phone number, and some other items.
<p>
If, after logging in, you still aren't able to edit your entry, check your profile to see what it displays as your Internet ID. If it's incorrect or unknown, let us know your X.500 username (at directory@physics.umn.edu), so we can correct it.
<p>
Some information, like office phone, room number, position, and so on, can't be edited directly, and changes to these should still be sent to directory@physics.umn.edu

<h4>Privacy of personal information</h4>

Your home address and home phone number are not normally displayed to anyone visiting the web site. The only people who can see this information are Physics and Astronomy users who have logged into the web site.
