<h2> September 30 -- Oct 3, 2012 <br>
                      St. Paul, Minnesota<br>
                "on the banks of the Mississippi" </h2>
<p>
Current transient surveys are finding SN-like events
which are not true supernovae.  Some of the "supernova impostors" are
suspected to be giant eruptions resembling eta Carinae, possibly related to
the Luminous Blue Variables.  Meanwhile, the most luminous true
supernovae are believed to be explosions into debris formed by previous
mass ejections, and two SNae were observed to have outbursts prior to their
final events.  All these developments emphasize the importance of instabilities and episodic mass loss in the most massive stars, but the
mechanisms remain mysterious.  Do they involve the outer layers, or the
core regions, or both?  How do stars above 50 solar masses end their lives? Do they just collapse to black holes?  Recent studies confirm that
classical Type II SN progenitors have much lower initial masses. Many of the
outstanding questions about final stages of very massive stars are primarily
theoretical, but observations are scarce, especially of the progenitor
class.
<p>
The meeting will be a three day topical workshop to bring together
theorists and observers studying very massive stars, their instabilities,
SNe and their progenitors, and the outcomes of the final eruptions.
The emphasis of the workshop will be on the final stages of massive
star evolution and the unsolved theoretical and observational questions.
