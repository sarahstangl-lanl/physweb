Two cities, one large metropolitan area with ~ 3.3 million people.
<p>
Historically, Fort Snelling was built (1819) at the junction of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers. At that time what became St. Paul was called PigsEye,
the town where 8th street was between 6th and 7th. It was renamed in 1841 and was the territorial capitol (1849) when Minnesota became a state (1858) .
St. Paul was a river and later a railroad town. Minneapolis (originally St. Anthony) was developed later (1849) at the head of navigation on the Mississippi (the Falls of St. Anthony)
as a milling city, and later became a banking center. Ethnically, St. Paul is Irish-German and Minneapolis is Swedish-Norwegian.
<p>
Today, St. Paul is the state capitol and is usually considered the quieter of the two cities. Minneapolis is often described as more upscale and modern than St. Paul with several
skyscrapers and a lively night scene. For many decades there was an economic and cultural rivalry between the cities which Minneapolis has definitely won.
<p>
The University of Minnesota (1856) is based in Minneapolis with a main campus that straddles the Mississippi and a smaller campus in St.Paul. Both cities are well known for their
live theater scene. There are also two orchestras, one in each city, and several professional sports teams, in each city.
<p>
To get a perspective on the exact site of the Workshop, we recommend reading the last chapter in Mark Twain's "Life on the Mississippi." F. Scott Fitzgerald was from St. Paul and
several of his short stories take place along Summit Ave. The Robert Altman/Garrison Keillor movie, "A Prairie Home Companion," was filmed at the Fitzgerald Theater, a short walk
from our meeting site.

<B>Things to do and events</B> -- if you are here a day or two before or after the Workshop:<p>
<b>In St. Paul </b>(St Paul is not a good shopping city. Minneapolis' Nicollet Ave and the Mall of America have a larger variety of stores.)<p>
Minnesota Science Museum (near the hotel) (www.smm.org)<p>
Minnesota History Center ( a long walk) (www.minnesotahistorycenter.org)<p>
State Capital (a longer walk or take a taxi)<p>
Cathedral Hill, Crocus Hill and Summit Avenue -- classic old residential area with numerous Victorian era and earlier homes. This is where the railroad and lumber barons built their
mansions. This is also F. Scott Fitzgerald's original territory. The J. J. Hill mansion (Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railroads, see the last chapter of the Great Gatsby) is
open for tours (www.mnhs.org/places/sites/jjhh).

It is a good hike up the hill or take a taxi to the cathedral.<p>
