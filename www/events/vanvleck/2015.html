<b>Margaret J. Geller Biography</b>
<ul>
    Margaret Geller received her B.A. (physics) from UC Berkeley in 1970 and her Ph.D..
from the Princeton University physics department in 1975. She joined the permanent staff
of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (part of the CfA) in 1983.
<p></p>
Geller is best know for her pioneering maps of the distribution of galaxies in the nearby
universe. Together with COBE observations of fluctuations in the microwave background,
these maps profoundly changed the view of large-scale structure in the universe. Geller has
also made substantial contributions to the study of galaxies and their environment. She
has developed and applied techniques for measuring the matter distribution in clusters of
galaxies. She is currently making a deeper map of the galaxy distribution called HectoMAP.
Geller is member of the National Academy of Sciences and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
She received a MacArthur Fellowship (1990), the Magellanic Premium
(2008), the James Craig Watson Medal (2010), the Russell Lectureship (2010), the Lilienfeld
Prize of the APS (2012), and the Schwarzschild Medal (2014) of the German Astronomical
Society. She is a Library Lion of the New York Public Library (1997) and she has received
6 honorary degrees including one from Dartmouth College (2014).
