<h2>About the Speaker</h2>
 Arthur McDonald is a native of Sydney, N.S. Canada. He has degrees in physics from Dalhousie University (BSc, MSc) and Caltech (PhD) and nine honorary degrees.
 From 1969-1982 he was a Research Officer at AECL Chalk River Laboratories; 1982-1989, Professor at Princeton University; 1989-2013 Professor at Queen's University,
 Kingston, Canada and 2013 became Professor Emeritus. Since 1989 he has been Director of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) Scientific Collaboration. Among many
 awards, he is a Companion of the Order of Canada; <b>Co-recipient of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics </b>and the 2007 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Physics; Co-recipient
 of the 2016 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics and the 2006 NSERC Polanyi Award with the SNO Collaboration. He continues to be active in basic research
 in Neutrinos and Dark Matter at the SNOLAB underground laboratory. He is a member of the Board of Directors of the Perimeter Institute.

<h2>About the Public Lecture</h2>
The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) was a 1,000 tonne heavy-water-based neutrino detector created 2 km underground in an active nickel mine near Sudbury, Canada. SNO
studied neutrinos from 8B decay in the Sun by observing one neutrino reaction sensitive only to solar electron neutrinos and others sensitive to all active neutrino flavors.
It found clear evidence for neutrino flavor change. This requires modification of the Standard Model for Elementary Particles and confirms solar model calculations with great accuracy.
Future measurements at the expanded SNOLAB facility will search for Dark Matter particles thought to make up 26% of our Universe and neutrino-less double beta decay, a rare form of
radioactivity that can tell us further fundamental properties of neutrinos. The lecture will provide a brief description of the science of SNO and the status and science to be addressed by SNOLAB experiments.
