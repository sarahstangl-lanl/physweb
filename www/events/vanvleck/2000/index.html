He holds a Chair in   Theoretical Physics at South Carolina and was honored with "The   Distinguished Scientist Governor Award of South Carolina" in 1993.    Professor Aharonov is a theoretical condensed matter physicist   studying nonlocal and topological effects in quantum mechanics,   relativistic quantum field theories and interpretations of quantum   mechanics.  Aharonov was a co-recipient of the 1998 Wolf Prize for   the discovery of the Aharonov-Bohm Effect.  Aharonov and the late   David Bohm proposed in 1959 that the form of the   quantum-mechanical coupling of electromagnetic fields to electrons   had some very counterintuitive implications for the behavior of   electrons.  Specifically, electrons passing through field-free   regions that surrounded a region of magnetic flux would acquire   different phases depending on whether they passed to the left or   to the right of the flux tube.  The phase difference, which can be   measured in an interference experiment depends on the flux   enclosed.  The controversial AB effect has been observed, and has,   in fact become an experimental tool in the domain of mesoscopic   physics.  Aharonov has also been recognized for this work by the   1995 Hewlett-Packard Europhysics Prize.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="palatino,serif">Professor Aharonov received his   undergraduate education at Technion University in Haifa, Israel   graduating with a B.Sc. in 1956.  He continued his studies at   Bristol University in England receiving a Ph.D. degree in 1960.    Aharonov came to the United States for a one-year postdoctoral   position at Brandeis University in 1960-61 prior to returning to   Israel and joining the faculty of Yeshiva University as an   Assistant Professor.  He was promoted to Associate Professor in   1964 and Professor in 1967 and held a joint appointment with   Yeshiva University and Tel Aviv University beginning in 1967 that   continued until 1973.  Aharonov began his current arrangement of a   joint position at Tel Aviv University and the University of South   Carolina in 1973.  He has published over 130 papers in refereed   journals during his career.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT FACE="palatino,serif">Professor Aharonov has been honored   with numerous awards from around the world.  In addition to the   Wolf and Hewlett-Packard Prizes he has received the Weizmann Prize   and Rothschild Prize in 1984; the Israel National Prize in Physics   in 1989; and the Elliot Cresson Medal in 1991.  Aharonov received   a Miller Research Professorship Award at Berkeley, 1988-89; the   Alex Maguy-Glass Chair in Theoretical Physics, Tel Aviv   University; and a Chair in Theoretical Physics, University of   South Carolina.  Honorary Doctorates have been awarded to Aharonov   from Technion&endash;Israel Institute of Technology, the   University of South Carolina, Bristol University and the   University of Buenos Aires.   Professor Aharonov was elected a   Member of the National Academy of Sciences in Israel and the   United States in 1990 and 1993, respectively and Fellow of the   American Physical Society in 1981.  </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;</P><P></P></BODY></HTML>
