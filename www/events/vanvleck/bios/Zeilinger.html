<h3>Positions</h3>
Anton Zeilinger is Professor of Physics at the University of Vienna and Scientific Director 
at the Institute of Quantum Optics and Quantum Information of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. 
Stages in his career include the Technical Universities of Vienna and Munich, the M.I.T., 
the University of Innsbruck, and the  Coll&#233ge de France. 

<h3>Awards</h3>
Among his distinctions are the Wolf prize in physics, the inaugural Isaac Newton Medal of the UK Institute of Physics,
 and the King Faisal Prize of Science. He is an honorary professor at the University of Science and Technology of 
 China, a Fellow of the American Physical Society, and member of seven scientific academies. 

<h3>Research</h3>
Zeilinger works both experimentally and theoretically on the foundations of quantum physics 
and their applications to quantum information science and technology. His fundamental 
experiments include quantum interference of neutrons, photons, atoms, and macromolecules, 
discovery and first realization of multiparticle entanglement, and precision tests of the 
concepts of reality and locality in quantum physics. These experiments and concepts have 
become central to the emerging field of quantum information science where Zeilinger 
performed pioneering realizations of quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography, and quantum computation. 

<h3>Books</h3>
Professor Zeilinger's writings in the field of quantum information have appeared in numerous anthologies on the topic.
In 2005 he wrote Einstein's Spuk (Einstein's Nightmare: teleportation and other mysteries of quantum physics,
published in German and in 2010 he wrote Dance of the Photons: From Einstein to Quantum Teleportation, published
in German and English.  The book is a top-selling selection among popular physics titles on Amazon.
