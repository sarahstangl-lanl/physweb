<%method title>Andre Geim Biographical Sketch</%method>

Andre Geim is the Royal Society and Langworthy Research Professor at the University of Manchester.  He is the Director of Manchester Centre for
Mesoscience and Nanotechnology.  He has received many international awards and distinctions, including medals from the US National Academy of
Sciences and the Royal Society and honorary doctorates from Delft University and ETH Zurich. Most notably, he was awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize
for his groundbreaking work on graphene, a one-atom-thick material made of carbon. 
<p>
According to bibliometric institute Thomson-Reuters, Andre Geim is responsible for initiating three new research fronts: diamagnetic levitation,
gecko tape and graphene. He is the only recipient of both Nobel and IgNobel Prizes. He has also received both Dutch and British knighthoods.

Andre Geim was born in Russia and holds dual British and Dutch citizenship. He started his academic career in Moscow in 1987, spent several
years as postdoctoral researcher at universities of Nottingham, Bath and Copenhagen and then moved to the Netherlands as associate professor
in 1994 before coming to Manchester in 2001 to take the Langworthy Chair.
