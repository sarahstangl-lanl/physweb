<i>Does the Everyday World Really Obey Quantum Mechanics?</i><br/>
Reception following lecture in Physics 216

<br/><blockquote>
Abstract: Quantum mechanics has been enormously successful in describing nature at the atomic level, and most physicists believe
that it is in principle the "whole truth" about the world even at the everyday level.  However, such a view prima facie leads to
a severe problem.   In certain circumstances, the most natural interpretation of the theory implies that no definite outcome of an
experiment occurs until the act of "observation."  For many decades this problem was regarded as "merely philosophical," in the
sense that it was thought that it had no consequences which could be tested in experiment.  However, in the last dozen or so years
the situation has changed very dramatically in this respect.  Leggett will discuss the problem, some popular "resolutions" of it,
the current experimental situation and prospects for the future. </blockquote>

<h5>Colloquium:</h5>

<blockquote>

4:00 p.m., Thursday, April 20, 2006 <br/>
Tate Laboratory of Physics, Room 150 <br/>
<i>BCuprate Superconductivity Without a Model </i><br/>
Refreshments served in room 216 at 3:30 p.m.
<br/>
<blockquote>Abstract: What can we reasonably say we know for sure about superconductivity in the cuprates, without reliance on any microscopic model?  On the basis of this knowledge and of some very generic and hopefully reasonable assumptions, are there interesting questions we can ask which we have some hope of answering definitively by experiment?   Identified is one such question, namely:  In which regions of momentum and frequency space is the inter-conduction electron Coulomb interaction energy saved (or expended) when the system becomes superconducting?  A possible answer to this question is conjectured and shown to be consistent with the dependence of the transition temperature on the c-axis layering structure.  This answer makes quantitative and experimentally testable predictions. </blockquote>
