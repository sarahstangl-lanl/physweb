Douglas Osheroff, the twenty-fourth
Van Vleck Lecturer, is Professor of
Physics and Applied Physics at
Stanford University. He is an
experimental physicist in the research
area of solid state, low temperature
physics. Professor Osheroff received
the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physics for
research work he did as a graduate
student at Cornell in the mid-1930's
and early 1970's. As a graduate
student with Professors David Lee and
Robert Richardson, Osheroff
discovered by chance the existence of a phase transition in a
mixture of liquid and solid He-3 at a temperature of about 2.6 mK,
where no transitions had been expected. This experiment led to a
seven month period during whch they slowly began to learn the
true nature of the new state of matter discovered. What had been
found were three new superfluid phases which can be described by
the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, originally developed
for superconductors. Studies of these phases have vastly
expanded the understanding of macroscopic quantum states and
have shown the broad applicability of BCS theory. Today, these
states represent model systems for testing our understanding of
remarkably diverse aspects of nature.

Professor Osheroff grew up in a medical family in a small logging
town on the west coast of Washington State where his father was a
doctor. At an early age Osheroff was interested in the natural
sciences. At the age of six he was tearing apart toys so he could
play with the electric motors. He continued his experimentation with
mechanical, chemical and electrical proiects, culminating in the
construction of a 100 keV X-ray machne during his senior year in
high schooL Osheroff chose the California Institute of Technology
for his undergraduate studies, receiving a B.S. degree in 1967. He
did his graduate studies at Cornell University receiving a Ph.D.
degree in 1973. In 1972 he accepted a permanent staff position at
Bell Laboratories and continued his studies on superfluid in He-3. In
1981 he was appointed Head of Sold State and Low Temperature
Physics Research. In 1987, after fitteen years at Bell Labs, he
accepted a faculty position at Stanford University. Stanford offered
him the opportunity to teach undergraduate and graduate students
as well as continue his work on superfluid and solid He-3. He has
received awards recognising his excellence in teaching. The day
Osheroff earned of his Nobel Prize, after only a few hours of sleep,
he taught his class on the physics of photography, although the
class was not on photographic lenses but the discovery of
superfluidity in He-3. He served as Chair of the Physics Department
at Stanlord from 1993-96.

Professor Osheroff has received many awards in addition to the
Nobel Prize. These include the 1998 AAPT Richtmyer Memorial
Lecture Award, the 1992 J.C. Jackson and C.J. Wood Chair in
Physics, the 1991 Walter J. Gores Award for Excellence in
Teaching, the 1981 MacArthur Prize, the 1981 Oliver E. Buckley
Prize, and the 1976 Sir Frances Simon Memorial Award. He was
elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1987 and the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1982. He is a fellow of
the American Physical Society and a member of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science.
