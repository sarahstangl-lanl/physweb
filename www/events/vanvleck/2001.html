<h4>Biographical Information</h4>


   <P>James W. Cronin, the twenty-sixth
   Van Vleck Lecturer, is University Professor of Physics Emeritus at
   the University of Chicago. Professor Cronin retired in 1996 after
   25 years on the faculty of the University of Chicago. He continues
   to be active in particle and astrophysics research, teaching and
   lecturing. Cronin's distinguished career has been recognized
   nationally and internationally with numerous awards including the
   Nobel Prize (with Dr. Val Fitch) in 1980 for their research
   activities during the 1960's while at Princeton University and the
   National Medal of Science in 1999. The Nobel Prize recognized the
   significance of Drs. Cronin and Fitch's experiment at Brookhaven
   National Laboratory. That experiment provided the first evidence
   that particles and anti-particles interact differently. One of the
   implications of this violation of "CP symmetry" is the very
   existence of our universe. Recently entire accelerators have been
   built in the US and Japan to extend our knowledge of CP violation.
   The National Science Foundation (NSF) recognized Dr. Cronin with
   The National Medal of Science at a White House ceremony with then
   President Bill Clinton citing Cronin "for fundamental
   contributions to the field of elementary particle physics and
   astrophysics and as a leader in creating an international effort
   to determine the unknown origins of very high-energy cosmic
   rays."
   
   <P>Currently Professor Cronin is the
   leader of the Pierre Auger experiment designed to probe the
   universe by detecting very rare high energy cosmic rays. This
   international experiment will assemble the world's largest
   particle detector array and use it to investigate the highest
   energy particles in our universe.
   
   <P>Professor Cronin was born in
   Chicago and studied for his M.S. (1953) and Ph.D. (1955) degrees
   at the University of Chicago. He received the B.S. degree from
   Southern Methodist University (1951). Cronin was awarded a NSF
   Fellowship for the period 1952-55. Following this fellowship he
   was on the scientific staff of Brookhaven National Laboratory for
   three years. In 1958 Cronin joined the faculty of Princeton
   University as Assistant Professor. He was promoted to Associate
   Professor in 1962 and Professor in 1964. Cronin continued his work
   at Princeton until his move to the University of Chicago in
   1971.
   
   <P>Professor Cronin has received many
   honors and awards for his scientific achievements. In addition to
   the Nobel Prize and the National Medal of Science he has been the
   recipient of Honorary Degrees from colleges in France and the UK,
   and held the International Chair at the College de France during
   1999-2000. Cronin has been honored by the American Academy of Arts
   and Sciences, 1982; received the Laureate of Lincoln Academy of
   Illinois (Medal of Order of Lincoln), 1981; and The Ernest O.
   Lawrence Award, 1977. Professors Cronin and Fitch received earlier
   recognition for their work with the John Price Wetherill Medal of
   the Franklin Institute, 1975 and a Research Corporation Award,
   1968. Professor Cronin's teaching has also been recognized with
   the University of Chicago Quantrell Award for Excellence in
   Undergraduate Education, 1994. He is a member of the National
   Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
   and the American Physical Society, serving as Chairman of the
   Division of Particles and Fields in 1985.
