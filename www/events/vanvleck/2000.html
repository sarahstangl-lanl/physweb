<h4>Biographical
Information</h4>

  <P>Yakir Aharonov, the twenty-fifth
   Van Vleck Lecturer, holds a joint appointment as Professor of
   Physics at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at the University of
   South Carolina in the United States.  He holds a Chair in
   Theoretical Physics at South Carolina and was honored with "The
   Distinguished Scientist Governor Award of South Carolina" in 1993.
    Professor Aharonov is a theoretical condensed matter physicist
   studying nonlocal and topological effects in quantum mechanics,
   relativistic quantum field theories and interpretations of quantum
   mechanics.  Aharonov was a co-recipient of the 1998 Wolf Prize for
   the discovery of the Aharonov-Bohm Effect.  Aharonov and the late
   David Bohm proposed in 1959 that the form of the
   quantum-mechanical coupling of electromagnetic fields to electrons
   had some very counterintuitive implications for the behavior of
   electrons.  Specifically, electrons passing through field-free
   regions that surrounded a region of magnetic flux would acquire
   different phases depending on whether they passed to the left or
   to the right of the flux tube.  The phase difference, which can be
   measured in an interference experiment depends on the flux
   enclosed.  The controversial AB effect has been observed, and has,
   in fact become an experimental tool in the domain of mesoscopic
   physics.  Aharonov has also been recognized for this work by the
   1995 Hewlett-Packard Europhysics Prize.
   
   <P>Professor Aharonov received his
   undergraduate education at Technion University in Haifa, Israel
   graduating with a B.Sc. in 1956.  He continued his studies at
   Bristol University in England receiving a Ph.D. degree in 1960. 
   Aharonov came to the United States for a one-year postdoctoral
   position at Brandeis University in 1960-61 prior to returning to
   Israel and joining the faculty of Yeshiva University as an
   Assistant Professor.  He was promoted to Associate Professor in
   1964 and Professor in 1967 and held a joint appointment with
   Yeshiva University and Tel Aviv University beginning in 1967 that
   continued until 1973.  Aharonov began his current arrangement of a
   joint position at Tel Aviv University and the University of South
   Carolina in 1973.  He has published over 130 papers in refereed
   journals during his career.
   
   <P>Professor Aharonov has been honored
   with numerous awards from around the world.  In addition to the
   Wolf and Hewlett-Packard Prizes he has received the Weizmann Prize
   and Rothschild Prize in 1984; the Israel National Prize in Physics
   in 1989; and the Elliot Cresson Medal in 1991.  Aharonov received
   a Miller Research Professorship Award at Berkeley, 1988-89; the
   Alex Maguy-Glass Chair in Theoretical Physics, Tel Aviv
   University; and a Chair in Theoretical Physics, University of
   South Carolina.  Honorary Doctorates have been awarded to Aharonov
   from Technion&endash;Israel Institute of Technology, the
   University of South Carolina, Bristol University and the
   University of Buenos Aires.   Professor Aharonov was elected a
   Member of the National Academy of Sciences in Israel and the
   United States in 1990 and 1993, respectively and Fellow of the
   American Physical Society in 1981.
