<b> Anton Zeilinger Bio</b><p></p>
<blockquote>
<b>Positions</b><br>
Anton Zeilinger is Professor of Physics at the University of Vienna and Scientific Director at the
Institute of Quantum Optics and Quantum Information of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. Stages in
his career include the Technical Universities of Vienna and Munich, the M.I.T., the University of
Innsbruck, and the College de France.
<p></p>
<b>Awards</b><br>
Among his distinctions are the Wolf prize in physics, the inaugural Isaac Newton Medal of the UK
Institute of Physics, and the King Faisal Prize of Science. He is an honorary professor at the
University of Science and Technology of China, a Fellow of the American Physical Society, and
member of seven scientific academies.<p></p>
<b>Research</b><br>
Zeilinger works both experimentally and theoretically on the foundations of quantum physics
and their applications to quantum information science and technology. His fundamental experiments
include quantum interference of neutrons, photons, atoms, and macromolecules, discovery and first
realization of multiparticle entanglement, and precision tests of the concepts of reality and locality
in quantum physics. These experiments and concepts have become central to the emerging field of quantum
information science where Zeilinger performed pioneering realizations of quantum teleportation, quantum
cryptography, and quantum computation.<p></p>
<b>Books</b><br>
Professor Zeilinger's writings in the field of quantum information have appeared in numerous anthologies
on the topic. In 2005 he wrote Einstein's Spuk (Einstein's Nightmare: teleportation and other mysteries
of quantum physics, published in German and in 2010 he wrote Dance of the Photons: From Einstein to Quantum
Teleportation, published in German and English. The book is a top-selling selection among popular physics titles on Amazon.
