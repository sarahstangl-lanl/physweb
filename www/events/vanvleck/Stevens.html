Charles F. Stevens, the twenty-third Van Vleck Lecturer, is
Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Investigator and Professor at
The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, San Diego California.
Dr. Stevens, a biophysicist, performs studies on neurobiology
focusing on molecular biology of synapses - the points at
which information flows from one nerve cell to the next.  He is
also interested in studying how the brain registers and processes
information .  His many contributions to science have been
recognized by members of the scientific community as evidenced
by his being elected to the National Academy of Sciences in
1982.  He is also a member of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences.

Dr. Stevens received his B.A. from Harvard University in 1956,
his M.D. from Yale University School of Medicine in 1960 and
his Ph.D. degree from Rockefeller University in 1964.  His
academic career began at the University of Washington,
Department of Physiology and Biophysics in 1963.  Stevens
spent a sabbatical year (1969-70) as a Guest Investigator at the
Lorentz Institute for Theoretical Physics, Leiden University,
Leiden, The Netherlands.  He remained on the University of
Washington faculty for twelve years until 1975 when he
accepted a position of Professor of Physiology at Yale
University School of Medicine.  He was at Yale from 1975-90
and held the position of Professor and Chairman of the Section
of Molecular Neurobiology, 1983-90.  While at Yale, Stevens
made fundamental contributions to the understanding of how
tiny channels open in cell membranes to admit carefully-
regulated flows of ions, leading to the electrical impulses that
underlie activity in the nervous system. Stevens was named Salk
Institute Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator in 1986
while still at Yale.  In 1990 he left Yale for the Salk Institute to
assume the position of Professor of Molecular Neurobiology.
At the Salk Institute, Dr. Stevens continued his studies on the
nervous system to improve our understanding of how
information is stored.

Dr. Stevens has written over 150 books and papers which have
appeared in publications such as "Nature", "Neuroscience
Letters", "Journal of Neurophysiology," "Current Biology", and
"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences".  He
received the Spencer Award from Columbia University in 1979
and the Grass National Lecturer Award from the Society for
Neuroscience in 1981.
