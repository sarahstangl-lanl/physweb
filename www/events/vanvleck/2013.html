    "A Random Walk to Graphene"<br></ul>
<br>
    Abstract: Graphene - a single plane of carbon atoms - is probably the simplest material one can imagine. On the other hand, graphene has acquired so many superlatives to its name that people started calling it a wonder material. I will discuss how this research started and, then, try to explain why graphene attracts so much attention these days.
