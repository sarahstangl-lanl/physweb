            We are proud to announce that the American Physical Society (APS) has designated Tate Lab as a site of historic significance for physics.
            This honors the pioneering work of the late Regents Professor Alfred O. C. Nier and his colleagues in the development and application of
            mass spectrometry.  Most famously, Tate was the location of first-ever separation of the Uranium-235 isotope more than 70 years ago.
