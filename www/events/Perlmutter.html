Nobel-prize winning scientist Saul Perlmutter presents a public lecture in conjunction with the Particle Physics Community Summer Study,
hosted at the University of Minnesota. Dr. Perlmutter will describe his research with Type Ia Supernovae, the exploding stars used as standard
candles to measure the expansion of the Universe  - and his unexpected discovery that the expansion is accelerating due to a mysterious component
known as "Dark Energy."   The lecture will take place on <b>Monday, July 29 at 8:00 p.m.</b> in the Great Hall of Coffman Memorial Union. Dr. Perlmutter
will also discuss the ongoing international research program that is trying to pin down the nature of the mysterious Dark Energy:  is it Einstein's
cosmological constant, a new form of energy or a breakdown of General Relativity?  Or something even stranger and more surprising?
<p>
<b>Saul Perlmutter</b> is a cosmologist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley.
Perlmutter is best known for his ground-breaking research with supernovae that led to the discovery that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating,
an unexpected result that is attributed to a mysterious "Dark Energy" that pervades the Universe. Perlmutter shared the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics for
this discovery, and has numerous other awards including the Department of Energy's E. O. Lawrence Award in Physics, the California Scientist of the Year Award,
the Shaw Prize in Astronomy, the Antonio Feltrinelli International Prize, the Gruber Cosmology Prize and the Albert Einstein Medal.

Reference to Saul Perlmutter was made on the popular CBS television comedy series The Big Bang Theory during the 2011 episode "The Rhinitis Revelation".
In a conversation with his mother, Sheldon says, "I've got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I'm taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his
Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I've worked up a couple of Q's that will stump his sorry A."
