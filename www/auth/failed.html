If login problems continue, please call 1-HELP (612-301-4357) and ask if your internet account is blocked for any reason. University of Minnesota OIT Security will sometimes block accounts from login to the wireless network or modem pool (if they detect a virus infection, for example), and this block will also affect login to our web site.
