<p>
The Society of Physics Students (SPS) at the University of Minnesota is an academic organization with a friendly social atmosphere.
SPS activities are centered in their own dedicated space within the School, where students can study and talk with other physics majors.
It also has a library of physics texts and a computer lab to help members with their studies.
<p>
Affiliation with the SPS is also a way for physics majors to find work in physics research.
Faculty members often check with the SPS to see if there are any undergraduates who are looking for teaching or research positions.
<p>
The SPS also holds regular social events such as bowling and movie nights, as well as yearly events such as a spring barbeque and a holiday party.
<p>
Our Society of Physics Students (SPS) has been selected as an Outstanding SPS Chapter for the 2014-2015 school year.
