The School of Physics and Astronomy annually recognizes undergraduate students of great promise with 20 scholarships and awards.  These have been established
through the generosity of many donors to the School with the goal of promoting high achievement and the drive to discover in our undergraduate majors.
Some awards recognize outstanding academic achievement in course work, some reward demonstrated potential for excellence in research, and a few are awarded
on the basis of overall excellence and achievement.  Specific awards range from $1,000 to $10,000, either directly applicable to tuition and fees or as
stipends supporting summer or academic year research with a member of the School's faculty.
