The undergraduate physics program at Minnesota offers a flexible, real-world approach to the physics 
major.  We offer physics major programs that prepare you for careers in engineering and applied 
physics, computer applications, secondary school teaching, or biomedical sciences as well as one that 
gives an excellent preparation of physics graduate work.  In addition we offer a liberal arts 
physics major, the liberal arts degree for the modern world.  Each of these programs is tailored 
to your specific needs by the careful choice of technical electives chosen in consultation with your 
physics advisor.

Physics learning is a process that involves intellectual engagement and hands-on experience.  
Imagination, creativity, real world problem solving, communication, and team work are an important 
part of the process.   We emphasize the important connection between reality and theory with a 
substantive laboratory component to every physics program.  Each includes  a year long course called 
Methods in Experimental Physics in which students get experience using modern experimental equipment, 
including computer interfacing, and end up designing, constructing, analyzing, and presenting the 
results of their own experiment. All physics majors are encouraged to participate in our research 
groups working on the frontiers of knowledge.  These positions often offer financial support either 
through the University's UROP program or directly from the research group.  Physics majors, 
especially those interested in pursuing an advanced degree or a career in teaching, can also obtain a 
teaching assistant position in the department.
