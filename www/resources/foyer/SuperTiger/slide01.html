<%method title>Primary objective:</title> Measure composition of cosmic rays with good statistics and
individual element resolution 30 &ge; Z &ge; 42 and exploratory measurements up to Z &ge; 56.
Test of OB-association source model for galactic cosmic rays.  Test of mass dependence of acceleration.
<p>
    Secondary objective: Energy spectra of elements 10 &ge; Z &ge; 28 .3-10 GeV/nuc. Search for evidence of nearby
    microquasars.
