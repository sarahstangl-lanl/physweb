<%method subtitle>Group managers</%method>

    <p>
    MyPhys groups may control listings in the School Directory; access to windows file shares; permission to edit or view web or wiki pages; physics mailing list subscriptions; and unix group membership, to give a few examples.
    </p><p>
    This page lists many of the groups you may be interested in, along with their assigned managers (to contact if you believe you need membership).
