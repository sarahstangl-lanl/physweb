<%method title>Electronic Grades submission</%method>

The Undergraduate Office will provide electronic grade book "templates" (as Excel files) on the web:
<ul>
<li>Go to the web URL <a href="http://www.physics.umn.edu/resources/classes/gradebooks/">http://www.physics.umn.edu/resources/classes/gradebooks/</a>
<li>Log in with your University of Minnesota X.500 username and password.
<i>Note - you'll only be able to access the files if your username is recognised in the department directory as a T.A.).</i>
<li>Click on your particular file and save it onto your desktop, then open the file.
<li><b>Do not change or alter in any way the order of the gradebook</b>
</ul>

Enter your scores, adding any new students to the bottom of the list. We will incorporate new names into the alphabetical list. The next quiz will have all the new list of names so you will not need to add them again.
<p class="note">
<li>Do not upload more than once! Bring any changes to room 148.
<li>Do not add any formulas, etc - the Undergraduate Office will add them.

<p>
To submit the completed gradebook:
<ul>
<li>Save the spreadsheet. Make sure you save it in Excel format!
<li>Go to the same web URL <a href="http://www.physics.umn.edu/resources/classes/gradebooks/">http://www.physics.umn.edu/resources/classes/gradebooks/</a>
<li>Log in with your University of Minnesota X.500 username and password.
<li>Follow the instructions given on the upload web page to upload the file to the server.
<p class="note">If you're using Netscape, click on the "Browse" button in the page, to open a file selector window, then in that window, change "Files of type" to read "All files". Select the file and continue.</p>
<li>Print a hard copy for your records
<li>Delete the spreadsheet file from your computer when you are sure the file is uploaded successfully (check with room 148). Don't keep old templates - new ones will be created as needed.
</ul>
