<h2>A brief user guide for personal profiles</h2>

<h3>Edit Directory Contact Information</h3>

<p>
This lets you update your information in the School directory: your preferred email address, home address and phone numbers, and other information. Note that personal data, such as home address and phone number, are not displayed to anyone apart from logged-in members of the department.
</p>

<h3>Edit Bio</h3>

<p>
This lets you update your personal information, the most important part of which is a short biographical introduction. You can also upload a photograph of yourself for the directory web page, and a PDF copy of your curriculum vitae
</p>

<h3>Edit Research/Activities</h3>

<p>
As well as a brief research summary, this page lets you enter a longer piece of text about your research or other projects. Images may also be uploaded and attached into the text using a simple tagging system.
</p>
<p>
The research summary should be kept brief, as it is displayed in several parts of the web site, such as lists of research group members.
</p>

<h3>Publications</h3>

<p>
You can also enter lists of publications, using the <i>Add/Edit Publication</i> link. The profiles page will list the most recent ten publications entered (though you can also mark publications as "selected" to make them display regardless of date).
</p>
<p>
The publications entry page also lets you enter some optional information, such as a web url for papers, or upload a copy of the paper in PDF format (assuming this is permitted by the publisher).
</p>

<h3>Text formatting</h3>

<p>
Within the large text fields for your research or biographical information, some simple formatting rules can be used.
</p>

</p>
For headings, enclose the heading text within '=', eg <tt>= Heading 1 =</tt> is a first-level heading<br/>
For bold, enclose your text within '*', eg <tt>*bold*</tt><br/>
For italic, enclose your text within double single-quotes, eg <tt>''italic''</tt><br/>
For lists, indent each line with four spaces.<br/>
For links, enclose the URL within square brackets.<br/>
For math, enclose your math text within <tt>$</tt> symbols (as in LaTeX math mode), eg <tt>$0 \le \beta \le 2\pi$</tt>
<p>
Example:
<pre>
  Here is some *bold* and some ''italic'' text.
      * an unordered list item one
      * unordered item two

      1. ordered list item one
      2. ordered item two
            a. nested one
            b. nested two

      literal code line one
      code line two

  The first line of a normal paragraph.
  The second line of a normal paragraph.  Whee.

<p>
The research text area has a set of buttons to automatically insert some of these tags for you.
</p>
<p>
The math formatting uses a subset of LaTeX commands, and will attempt to convert them to HTML. Some trial and error may be necessary.
