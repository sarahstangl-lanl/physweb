<h1>General Information</h1>
<p>Click an element or the +/- sign next to it to expand/collapse it</p>
<p>Double-click an element to rename it</p>
<p>Drag elements over other elements and drop them to add them</p>
<p>Multiple elements can be selected at once by dragging over an area</p>
<p>Columns scroll automatically if you drag to their edges</p>
<p>Italicized computers have no cluster assigned and have been added to the default cluster</p>

<h1>Adding Elements</h1>
<p>To add an element to another element, simply drag the element to the target element and drop it.  The target *should* turn blue if it will accept the item being dragged.</p>
<p>Multiple elements can be selected at once by clicking in an area not occupied by an element and dragging the mouse over a group of elements.
If there are elements that aren't visible, you can get to them by dragging the mouse to the edges of the column - the column should scroll automatically.</p>

<h1>Renaming Elements</h1>
<p>Many elements can be renamed by double-clicking on them.
When finished editing the name, you can hit enter or tab or click away from the element.
Currently computers and cluster cannot be renamed through this interface.</p>

<h1>Removing Elements</h1>
<p>To remove an element, simply drag and drop the item over one of the trash icons.  If the trash icon changes, the item being dragged can be deleted.
<p>Just as with adding elements, multiple elements can be selected at once.
When multiple non-root elements are selected, the trash icons will change to a red X, allowing you to remove the elements without having to drag them.
Currently computers and cluster cannot be deleted through this interface.</p>

<h1>Undo</h1>
<p>In many cases the last remove action can be undone by clicking one of the undo buttons.
If multiple elements were involved in the last action, the action will be undone for each element.  Only one level of undo is stored.
Currently, removing the root nodes of any tree cannot be undone.</p>

<h1>Logging</h1>
<p>A log console can be opened to view any errors.
If something appears to have gone amiss, try clicking the Console link to see if any messages have been printed.
The link should change to red any time something is written to the log.
Currently the log does not refresh automatically, but can be refreshed by clicking the Refresh button in the console or the Console link on the Management page.
