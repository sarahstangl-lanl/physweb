<h4>OBSERVATION DECIMAL CST COLUMN</h4>
Convert your Clock Time to Decimal CST. Follow the methods below.
<br>
1. If you observation is in PM, add 12 hours.
<br>
2. Are you in daylight savings time? If so, subtract 1 hour.
<br>
3. Divide the minutes by 60.
</%method>
<%method help_dayNumber>
<h4>DAY NUMBER COLUMN</h4>
Write down the day number for the date you took the observation. For example, Jan 1 = Day 1, Jan 2 = Day 2, Jan 31 = Day 31, Feb 1 = Day 32, Feb 2 = Day 33, etc.... You can also find the day number <a href="http://www.astro.umn.edu/~ayoung/calendarw.html" target="new">here</a>.
<h4>DAY: Day Number check</h4>

<h4>EHA: Elongation from your Moon's and Sun's Hour Angle Calculation check</h4>
You did not calculate your elongation correctly from your Sun's HA and Moon's HA
<h4>Commonly Made Mistakes:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Elongation can never be negative. If it is, add 360. This will make it
positive.
<li>Elongation can only go from 0 to 359.99. 360 is the same thing as 0.
</ol>
<h4>EDT: Elongation on that Date check</h4>
<h4>Commonly Made Mistakes:</h4>
<ol>
<li>The calculation for Elongation depends on two things: Moon's HA and Sun's HA. Check to see if they are both correct.
<li>If Sun's HA (SHC box) is red, please fix the Sun's HA calculation.
<li>If Moon's HA (MHF box) is red, please fix the Moon's HA calculation.
