When we are sent here:
  1) either we are returning from authing to shibboleth, so if there is a session tag to redirect back somewhere follow it.
  2) some other way? redirect to home page

# Save session stuff again, and most important remember the shibb tab as default from now on

    -name => 'UMNPHYS_PERSIST',

        You should have been redirected to your destination. If not click <a href="<% $s |h%>">here</a>

        You seem to have authed but we were unable to access your shibboleth session information. Try clearing your cookies and try again.
