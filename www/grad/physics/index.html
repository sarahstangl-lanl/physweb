Our graduate program offers students the opportunity to work at the cutting edge of 
contemporary research. The program is large enough (about 140 students) to provide varied 
opportunities for research and networking, yet small enough to keep individual students 
from feeling lost in the shuffle. Many of our students come straight from 
undergraduate studies in small colleges.  Students also like Minnesota because of the 
opportunities provided by both the large, diverse university and the very livable 
metropolitan area. 
<p>
Our graduate program starts with coursework in classical mechanics, electricity 
and magnetism, quantum physics, and thermal/statistical physics. In addition, some students study mathematical physics 
or general relativity, while others start an intermediate exploration of a subfield such as 
elementary particle physics or condensed matter physics. A few students, with thorough 
preparation, proceed directly to advanced courses at the very beginning of their residence. 
Others  fill in gaps in their undergraduate programs.
<p>
One unique aspect of the graduate program in physics at the University of Minnesota is the 
ability to get a physics degree with an adviser outside of the School of Physics.  Some 
faculty in Astronomy, Biophysics, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Chemistry, 
Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering hold graduate faculty appointments in 
physics and can direct the research of physics graduate students.
