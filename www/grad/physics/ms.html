<%method title>M.S. Degree</%method>

<p>
We offer a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in physics. This degree can be a path to
a Ph.D. in physics, other higher level graduate degrees, academic careers or industrial ones. 
<p>
Some of our students obtain an M.S. degree before they move on to a Ph.D. degree. This is not
required, but can provide you with an opportunity to explore a research area before committing
to a doctoral program. 
<p>
We offer three M.S. degree plans: one with an emphasis on thesis; and two with an emphasis on
coursework. Students should expect that completion of an M.S. degree would take two academic
years of full-time study including at least one semester of intensive research. 

<dl>
<dt><b>Plan A (Thesis)</b></dt>
<dd>
Plan A requires a thesis based on original research. A total of 20 course credits is required including
14 credits of graduate-level courses. In addition, Plan A requires registration for 10 thesis credits,
which suggests that you devote about 20 hours/week over a semester in research. 
</dd>
<br>
<dt><b>Plan B (Non-Thesis)</b></dt>
<dd>
A total of 30 course credits is required. Plan B requires either a project (4 credits of Physics 8500)
or three papers which do not require original research. 
</dd>
<br>
<dt><b>Plan C (Coursework and Graduate Written Exam)</b></dt>
<dd>
A total of 30 credits is required. Plan C requires a minimum GPA of 3.3 and passing the Graduate Written Exam.
