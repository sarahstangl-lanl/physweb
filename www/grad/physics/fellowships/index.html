<%method title>Graduate Prizes and Fellowships</%method>

<p>A number of Physics Department and/or Graduate School Fellowships are
available.  These may be in addition to or instead of a Teaching
Assistantship.  If you are interested in obtaining fellowship support
please apply no later than December 15.  Nothing further is needed
other than an early application following the normal procedures. We will
nominate several of the early applicants based on the information
provided in their application materials for these awards. Graduate
School Fellowship candidates will need to submit a Graduate School
application in January.  Decisions are expected in late February or
early March.</p>
