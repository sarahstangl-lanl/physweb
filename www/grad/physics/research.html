Research Areas at Minnesota are broad and diverse.
While most research is done on campus, 
Minnesota physicists work on research in projects around the world. 
</p>
<p>
Students are encouraged to participate in research as early as possible. 
They have opportunities to attend colloquia and seminars, and to interact with 
faculty and other students. These activities, as well as special introductory seminars, are designed to facilitate the selection of a research field that can become one's life work.  If a particular field is not as interesting as anticipated, there will be time to select another.
