The Physics Graduate Student Organization, Gradphi, organizes social and cultural activities, 
such as the annual Halloween Party, to promote non-academic interaction among physics 
graduate students. Gradphi also provides an organized voice for physics graduate students in 
the consideration of issues within the School of Physics and Astronomy.

<h4>WIPA</h4>

<a href="https://zzz.physics.umn.edu/groups/wipa/home">Women in Physics and Astronomy</a> The Women in 
Physics and Astronomy (WiPA) group was established to raise awareness throughout the entire 
school of not only the important contributions women have made and continue to make in physics 
and astronomy, but also about the various mechanisms that make it difficult for women to make 
those contributions. Planned activities raise the visibility of women within the school and 
encourage interactions amongst female graduate students, faculty and/or research associates. 
It is hoped that the Women in Physics and Astronomy group will encourage a respectful climate 
for women in the school.
