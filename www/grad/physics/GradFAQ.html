<p>

<h4>What term of entry should I apply for?</h4>
The Physics Graduate Program only accepts applications for Fall admissions. If you would like request an exception to this policy,
please email <a href="mailto:grad@physics.umn.edu?cc=kapusta@physics.umn.edu&amp;subject=Fall Admissions Exception Request">grad@physics.umn.edu</a>
for more details.

<p>

<h4>What is the deadline?</h4>
<b>December 26, 2016 </b>is the deadline for international applications. Early application is advisable.

to inquire if late applications are being accepted.

<p>

<h4>I have a degree related to physics. What courses will I need to take before admission?</h4>
All four of the core physics courses at the junior or senior undergraduate level are required for full
preparation for admission: analytical mechanics, electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics
& statistical physics. Some applicants with unique backgrounds may be allowed to take missing classes
after they matriculate. 

<p>

<h4>Is it possible to obtain a degree in Physics at night and on weekends?</h4>
No.  We do not offer courses at night or on weekends.

    <i><b>**</b>Official transcripts and TOEFL scores are not required until admission has been offered and accepted by the applicant.</i>
    
<p>

<h4>Do you also need to receive official transcript by December 26th?</h4>

Paper copies can be sent directly to the Graduate School. Please note that paper copies will delay the processing
of your application.

<p>

<h4>How can I check the status of my application or application materials?</h4>
To check your application status, log into your application through ApplyYourself. You will see the Application for
Admission section, which contains updates about the status of your application materials, including letters of
recommendation, standardized test scores (like GRE or TOEFL), and transcripts.

<p>

<h4>Can I change my application after it has been submitted?</h4>
Please try to complete your application carefully before you submit. If absolutely necessary, changes to your
application can be considered by sending your request to <a href="mailto:grad@physics.umn.edu?cc=kapusta@physics.umn.edu&amp;subject=Request to Modify Application">grad@physics.umn.edu</a>.
Updated test scores are automatically reflected in the ApplyYourself application system upon receipt of new scores by the Graduate School. 

<p>

<h4>When will I hear if I have been accepted?</h4>
A decision regarding your application will be made late February to early April through Apply Yourself.

<p>

<h4>How many students were admitted to your program last year?</h4>
We aim to have 25 to 30 entering students every year. 

<p>

<h4>Can I have an advisor outside of Physics?</h4>
Yes, as long as he/she does physics-related research. Please see the list of our graduate faculty members 
<a href="https://www.physics.umn.edu/people/faculty/physgradfac.html">here</a>.

<p>

<h4>Does everyone who gets admitted have their tuition waived?</h4>
We only offer financial support to those applicants admitted to our PhD program. We offer no financial support (tuition benefit, stipend, etc.)
to those applicants applying to our Master's Degree program. Please contact <a href="mailto:grad@physics.umn.edu?subject=Master's Degree Inquiry">grad@physics.umn.edu</a>

<a name="Related"><h1>Applying for related programs</h1></a>

<p>

<h4>I want to apply to the Physics program and another graduate program outside of physics. 
Can I apply to both programs?</h4>
Yes, you can apply to both programs but you will need to complete and submit two different applications through ApplyYourself. Please note
that this means you will also have to pay two application fees if the other program requires one. You will also have to check with the
other program(s) on their admission application requirements. Please see <a href="http://www.grad.umn.edu/admissions/application_instructions/faq_13/index.html">this page</a> for more information. 

<p>

<h4>I am interested in Astrophysics.  Do I apply to Physics or Astronomy?  </h4>
We suggest if your main interest is in cosmology then apply to Physics.  If you are interested in astronomy then apply to the Astrophysics
program.  You can apply to both programs. Please see <a href="http://www.grad.umn.edu/admissions/application_instructions/faq_13/index.html">this page</a>
for the Graduate School's policy on applying to more than one program. More information about the Astrophysics program can be found
<a href="http://www.astro.umn.edu/grad/">here</a>.

<a name="GPA"><h1>Questions about GPA</h1></a>

<p>

<h4>I am an international student. The university in our country does not issue grades or GPA.  
They issue percentage points.  How do I translate these numbers in to grades or GPA?</h4>
There is no need to translate these numbers in to grades or GPA. You will have the opportunity
to specify the grading scale in the online application.

<p>

<h4>What is the minimum GPA for admission?</h4>
While there is no minimum GPA, if your GPA is less than 3.3 the possibility of acceptance is low. 

<p>
<p>

<a name="GRE"><h1>Questions about the GRE</h1></a>

<p>

<h4>What is the institution code for the GRE?</h4>
Our institution code is 6874.  

<p>
    
<h4>What is the deadline for GRE scores to be considered as part of my application?</h4>
GRE scores should be submitted by <b>January 3rd.</b>  The unofficial, self-reported score is sufficient
for the Physics program to consider your application until the Graduate School receives your official scores. 

<p>

<h4>Do I need to take the GRE if I am only applying to the Master's program in Physics?</h4>
Students are admitted for a terminal Master's degree only if they do not need financial support of any
kind, including teaching assistantships. 

<p>

<h4>I have taken my GRE, but have not been notified of the score. Can I still apply?</h4>
Yes. You can indicate the date of your most recent exam on the Test Information page in the online application.
Official GRE scores must be sent directly to the institution from the testing center. Your application will
automatically reflect any updated test scores. 

<p> 

<h4>Can I be admitted without the GRE?</h4>
Yes, the GRE is not an absolute requirement; however, not having the GRE may put you at a slight disadvantage.
If the other parts of your application - GPA, research experience and publications, and letters of recommendation -
are strong, it will help compensate for not taking the GRE.

<p>

<h4>What are the average GRE scores of the program&#39s admitted applicants?</h4>
The percentile averages for all admitted applicants between 2006-2014 are:<br>
<ul>	Verbal average: 68% (standard deviation: 24)<br>
	Quantitative average: 89% (standard deviation: 9)<br> 
	Writing average: 46% (standard deviation: 28)<br>
	Physics subject Average: 69% (standard deviation: 21)<br>

</ul>

Exceptions to the English language requirement are made for students who have completed one academic 
year (nine months) in residence as a full-time student (16 semester credits, 24 quarter credits) in the 
last 24 months at an institution within the United States or other English-speaking countries.
These students are not required to present English language scores for admission, but will be assessed 
for English proficiency on arrival at the University. The policy can be found <a href="http://www.grad.umn.edu/admissions/application_instructions/toefl/index.html">here</a>.
<p>
Based on the score received on the local test, as many as two English language courses may be assigned 
in the first semester of enrollment.  Contact Laurie Hoppe, assistant to the dean and member of The Graduate 
School admissions staff, at <mailto:hoppe003@umn.edu>, or (612)-625-8570,
