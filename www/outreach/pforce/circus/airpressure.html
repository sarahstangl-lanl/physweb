<h2>Air Pressure</h2>
<h4>Vocabulary</h4>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><b>air pressure:</b>
   Pressure exerted by the weight of air on an object in that air.
   There will be discussion about this when we describe the reason
   for the plunger being held onto a piece of clear plexiglass, when
   the rubber playground softball base is used to lift a chair using
   air pressure, when we use the Magdeburg disks being held together
   by air pressure and when we crush a 55-gallon drum using air
   pressure.</FONT>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>atmospheric
   pressure:</b> This is also the pressure caused by air, but
   usually thought of as the normal value or standard value of 14.7
   pounds per square inch. The atmospheric pressure at the place
   where we are on the face of the earth is usually less than this
   because we are above sea level, and hence have less "weight"
   pushing down on us. Again, used with the same activities as air
   pressure.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>cavity:</B> A hollowed
   out or empty space enclosed by some form of walls, in this case
   the walls will be formed by the rubber softball base and the top
   of the chair it will be lifting.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>condensation:</b> The
   changing of a gas into a liquid. In this case we will be
   discussing the condensation of water vapor into liquid water when
   we discuss the reasons for the 55-gallon drum being collapsed.
   When water vapor condenses to liquid water, it takes up
   considerably less space, and this is very important in reducing
   the pressure inside the drum.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>force: </B> Simply a
   push or a pull. We will be talking about force as we describe the
   force caused by air pressure on the plunger and plexiglass, chair
   and rubber softball base, the two Magdeburg disks, and the force
   exerted on the 55-gallon drum.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>high pressure:</B> A
   space where the pressure is more pounds per square inch than a
   neighboring space. We will be discussing the idea that the
   pressure is higher outside the 55-gallon drum than inside the
   drum.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>low pressure:</B> A
   space where the pressure is fewer pounds per square inch than a
   neighboring space. We will use this term along with the term high
   pressure in order to describe the resulting force that will tend
   to push something one way or the other.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>Magdeburg:</B> A city
   in Germany where a scientist first demonstrated the large amount
   of air pressure that we all live in. It was done by removing the
   air from between two large hemispheres that were sealed air tight
   and then two teams of horses were engaged to try to pull them
   apart. Having not been able to do it with the horses, the
   scientist then walked over to the hemispheres, opened a valve to
   let air back into the cavity between the hemispheres and they fell
   apart. We will be doing a similar type of activity using
   plexiglass disks which we will call Magdeburg Disks.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>molecular motion:</B>
   The name given to the intrinsic property of all matter that is at
   normal temperature where the molecules of that matter are in a
   constant state of motion. We will be using this concept to help
   describe what causes air pressure. The molecules of air are forced
   downward by gravity, and also are in a constant state of movement,
   thus causing an enormous number of collisions in one second with
   the outsides of the plunger and plexiglass, the Magdeburg disks,
   the chair and the rubber base and the 55-gallon drum. When taken
   all together, these collisions cause the pressure against these
   objects.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>pressure: </B> In the
   context of our show, it will be the number of pounds per square
   inch exerted by gaseous molecules. When the number of pounds per
   square inch are multiplied by the number of square inches on an
   object, it is possible to determine the total force, the push on
   the object.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>steam: </B> The gaseous
   state of water when it is heated above 100&#186; Celsius at
   standard atmospheric pressure. When we heat the water in the
   55-gallon drum, it will boil and turn to steam.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>vacuum:</B> A space
   where there is no pressure, usually caused by the lack of any
   molecules. A totally empty space is another way of describing it.
   We will be talking about the partial vacuum produced by several
   situations which we will create. Thus, in our partial vacuum,
   there will be very low pressure but perhaps not a totally empty
   space.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>vapor:</B> The gaseous
   state of a substance that is, under normal conditions, a liquid
   but the gas is not at a temperature above its boiling point. Thus,
   the moisture in the air (humidity) can be called water vapor.
   There will be water vapor in the area above the water in the
   55-gallon drum before we seal it off and then cool it. This water
   vapor will condense, causing less space to be taken up by the
   water molecules. Consequently the barrel will have a partial
   vacuum in it, causing a large difference in pressure from inside
   to outside.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>volume:</B> In the
   context of this show, it can be thought of as space defined by an
   enclosure of some kind. It is 3 dimensional much like a box, but
   not necessarily having square corners. One of the volumes we will
   be working with is in the form of a cylinder-the 55 gallon drum.
   In the chair lift, we will have a volume of irregular shape, we
   will call it a cavity. </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">A common toilet plunger
   will be used to stick to a clear piece of plexiglass. The clear
   plexiglass shows that there is nothing in the plunger, but it is
   "stuck" to the plexiglass. </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>How it happens </B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">The reason this happens is
   because the air is forced out from between the plunger and
   plexiglass and when the plunger tries to straighten up again,
   there is a low-pressure area created under the plunger, and the
   higher atmospheric pressure pushes the plunger onto the
   plexiglass. </FONT>

<& /mason/image.comp, filename=>'ap1.gif' &>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">Thus, the plexiglass and plunger
   are squeezed together by atmospheric pressure. The usual term used
   is that the plunger is held to the plexiglass with "suction".
   There is no such thing as suction, only a lowering of the pressure
   in one place or another.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">When your vacuum cleaner cleans
   up dust or dirt, it does not "suck up" anything. It creates a
   lower pressure (vacuum) in the hose, and the higher atmospheric
   pressure pushes the dust or dirt into the hose and on into the
   container in your cleaner that accepts the dirt and
   dust.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">One of the common
   misconceptions about air pressure is that it acts in the direction
   we call down. This is partly because of the explanation of air
   pressure as the weight of the air (14.6 pounds on average at sea
   level) above any square inch of earth surface. And weight acts
   downward with the pull of gravity. For a full understanding you
   must add the concept that once a fluid (gases are fluids) is under
    pressure the fluid than exerts this pressure in all directions
   including up. It may be better to think of air pressure as the
   result of all the little pushes of the air molecules bouncing off
   every square inch of surface the air has contact with. It may be
   difficult to comprehend, but there are over a sextillion (1021)
   such collisions for each square inch of surface each second at
   normal air pressure. </FONT>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">When you pull on the trigger
   (plunger) of a squirt gun you pull towards yourself yet the water
   shoots in the opposite direction due to this phenomenon of
   fluids.</FONT></P>

   When the demonstrator lifts on the handle, there is a small cavity

   pressure of the atmosphere to push the rubber base and the top of

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">The average man can, using

   one half as much pressure as normal atmospheric pressure. This
   means approximately 7 to 8 pounds per square inch. The normal
   atmosphere has about 15 pounds per square inch. Now with the area
   of the two disks being approximately 70 to 80 square inches, the
   difference in pressure produces about 500 pounds of force tending
   to hold the two disks together. Thus, he would have to weigh about
   500 pounds to pull the two disks apart using his weight!</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">The vacuum pump will reduce
   the pressure between the disks to a very low value, less than one
   pound per square inch. This means there is a difference of over 14
   pounds per square inch of pressure tending to push the disks
   together. The area of the disks is about 115 square inches.
   Multiply this by approximately 14.2 pounds per square inch, and
   you realize it would take over 1,600 pounds of force to pull the
   disks apart! Because of the way forces behave, each student would
   have to pull with over 160 pounds to pull them apart. This is very
   difficult even for adults when pulling horizontally. </FONT>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">The valve is then opened to let
   air back in between the disks to raise the pressure to atmospheric
   pressure. As soon as the pressure between the disks is equal to

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">The demonstrators will

   see dispensing fuel oil or pesticides on a farm. It will be
   standing vertically on a stand, with heat being applied to it. The
   demonstrators will turn off the heat, thread in a plug in the
   opening on the top, and begin to spray water on the barrel with
   spray bottles. After a period of a couple of minutes the barrel
   will crush to a smaller size, bending and twisting the metal quite
   profoundly. It will do this in a split second, with a rather loud
   sound.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>How it happens:</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">This is the finale in a
   series of demonstrations designed to demonstrate the incredible
   pressure of the atmosphere. The barrel has about 3 liters of water
   in it, which has been boiling for a few minutes. This boiling
   causes the air inside to be forced out and replaced with hot water
   vapor. There will be steam coming out the opening at the top as it
   comes out on stage which shows most, if not all, of the air has
   been forced out of the barrel. </FONT>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">When the demonstrator removes the
   heat and caps the opening, it begins the process of cooling the
   barrel and its contents. This causes the steam in the barrel to
   condense into water, thus significantly reducing the volume of the
   contents. When this takes place, the pressure is lowered inside
   the barrel, and now the atmospheric pressure outside the barrel
   will be much greater than the pressure inside. It turns out that
   the barrel can withstand about 9 pounds per square inch
   difference, but beyond that it is simply too much pressure for the
   metal to withstand and it collapses. </FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">Because the barrel is round and
   reinforced with ribs along its outside, it builds up quite a lot
   of tension and when some imperfection in the roundness occurs, the

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">The force of air pressure
   can be shown simply by boiling water in an aluminum pop can and
   plunging it top down into cold water. Air pressure is about 15
   pounds per square inch so the total pressure on a pop can could be
   above 200 pounds.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">Place a small amount of
   water in the pop can (20 ml-30 ml) and bring to a vigorous boil.
   When a good head of steam is coming out of the top, pick the can
   up, flip it over, and plunge it into the cool water top down. The
   water will seal the opening of the can and cause the water vapor
   in the can to condense. As the steam inside the can condenses the
   pressure inside the can will decrease dramatically. The can will
   crush due to the higher air pressure outside the can. The can will
   be hot enough to burn, so don't forget to wear the gloves.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
