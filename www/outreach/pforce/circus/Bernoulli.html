<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>air pressure </B>: Pressure exerted
by the weight of air on an object in that air. There will be
discussion about this when we describe the reason for the plunger
being held onto a piece of clear plexiglass, when the rubber
playground softball base is used to lift a chair using air pressure,
when we use the Magdeburg disks being held together by air pressure
and when we crush a 55-gallon drum using air
pressure.</FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>atmospheric pressure: </B> This is
also the pressure caused by air, but usually thought of as the normal
value or standard value of 14.7 pounds per square inch. The
atmospheric pressure at the place where we are on the face of the
earth is usually less than this because we are above sea level, and
hence have less "weight" pushing down on us. Again, used with the
same activities as <B>air pressure.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>high pressure:</B> A space where the
pressure is more pounds per square inch than a neighboring space. We
will be discussing the idea that the pressure is higher outside the
55-gallon drum than inside the drum.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>low pressure:</B> A space where the
pressure is fewer pounds per square inch than a neighboring space. We
will use this term along with the term <B>high pressure</B> in
order to describe the resulting <B>force</B> that will tend to
push something one way or the other.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>molecular motion:</B> The name given
to the intrinsic property of all matter that is at normal temperature
where the molecules of that matter are in a constant state of motion.
We will be using this concept to help describe what causes air
pressure. The molecules of air are forced downward by gravity, and
also are in a constant state of movement, thus causing an enormous
number of collisions in one second with the outsides of the plunger
and plexiglass, the Magdeburg disks, the chair and the rubber base
and the 55-gallon drum. When taken all together, these collisions
cause the pressure against these objects.</FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>pressure:</B> In the context of our
show, it will be the number of pounds per square inch exerted by
gaseous molecules. When the number of pounds per square inch are
multiplied by the number of square inches on an object, it is
possible to determine the total <B>force</B>, the push on the
object.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>WHAT TO LOOK FOR</B></FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><IMG SRC="Bernoulli1.gif" WIDTH=183 HEIGHT=121 ALIGN=bottom></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva">This
is a simple demonstration dealing with Bernoulli&#146;s Principle.
The demonstrator will hold a piece of paper close to his lips, and
blow across the top of the paper as it hangs down from his hands in
front of his lips. The paper will respond by moving up, toward the
stream of moving air. It would seem the paper would move away from
the stream of air, but it does not. It moves toward the stream of
air. This is shown in the diagrams below:</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><IMG SRC="Bernoulli2.gif" WIDTH=162 HEIGHT=102 BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>HOW IT HAPPENS</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Bernoulli&#146;s principle states that fluids
in an area moving faster than the the surrounding area possess less
pressure. Faster-moving fluid, lower pressure. (In general, fluids
include liquids and gasses. Air is a gas and as such is classified as
a fluid.) When the demonstrator holds the paper in front of his mouth
and blows across the top, he is creating an area of faster-moving
air. The slower-moving air under the paper now has higher pressure,
thus pushing the paper up, towards the area of lower pressure.
Perhaps you have noticed, for example, that an empty mayonnaise jar
in your sink with water in it will move in, directly under the water
faucet as you turn on the water. This is the same thing as we observe
here. The water that is moving possesses less pressure, and the jar
is pushed toward that area by the water that is not moving which has
greater pressure.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Geneva" COLOR="#0000CC"><B>Toilet Paper
a Tree</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Bernoulli&#146;s Principle, when the speed of
a fluid is increased the pressure in the fluid decreases, can be
illustrated using the air from a leaf blower or a vacuum cleaner. The
jet of air is the moving fluid which has the reduced pressure in it.
If this reduced pressure is on the top of an object the normal
atmospheric pressure below the object can lift the object. The object
in this demonstration is a roll of toilet paper which is lifted and
then move along with the jet of air. A full roll of toilet paper can
be put into the air in a few seconds using this method.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Materials</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A leaf blower or vacuum cleaner (adjusted to
blow air). a roll of toilet paper, and rod for the toilet paper to
spin on.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Instructions</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Slip the rod through the cylinder in the
toilet paper to allow it to spin. Most any rod will work, a tube use
to protect golf clubs works very well. Have one person hold the rod
by placing a hand on each side of the toilet paper roll. The hose or
tube the direct the jet of air should be placed above the paper and
aimed in a steep upward direction. Experiment a bit with the right
angle and distance from the paper to get the maximum elevation and
speed of the toilet paper.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>(Bernoulli)</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">To explain this demonstration a good
understanding of the Bernoulli effect along with terminal velocity is
required. The ball is held up by the wind blast putting the ball at
it&#146;s terminal velocity. The ball moves up if the wind is faster
than terminal or moves down towards faster air if the air speed is
less than terminal velocity. The ball will always settle in at the
right point where terminal velocity air is moving up and flowing
around the ball.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The bigger question is why the ball stays
centered in the stream of air? The air in the center of the air
stream will be moving a little faster than the air towards the edge.
This is due to the fact that the air at the sides rubs on the
stationary air in the room and is slowed a little. If the ball begins
to drift off center the faster air passing the ball will be on the
side back towards the center. In Bernoulli faster air produces less
pressure and the larger pressure (slower air) on the outside will
cause the ball to be recentered. If you watch the ball you can see it
being recentered almost all the time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>(Bernoulli)</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This demonstration relies on the Bernoulli
Principle, which states that when fluid moves its ability to produce
pressure is lowered and the faster the movement the lower the
pressure. Fluids include liquids and gases and air is a mixture of
gases, and is therefore a fluid. The ping pong ball sags until the
top of the ball is in the fast air, being shot through the barrel,
and the bottom is in the quiet air of the room. The quiet air has
more pressure pushing up and keeping the ball from
falling.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>Materials</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A ballpoint pen barrel or soda straw, a small
piece of thread, a ping pong ball and some glue to attach the string
to the pen barrel and the ping-pong ball.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><IMG SRC="Bernoulli4.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=118 BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom><FONT FACE="Times"><br/>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Attach the thread (about 3 to 4 inches in
length) to the pen barrel and to the ping-pong ball. Hold the pen
barrel horizontally and blow vigorously through it while holding the
ping-pong ball in line with the tube to get it in the path of the
rapidly moving air. Then let go of the ping-pong ball, and it will
stay in the moving air, since that is where the pressure is lowest.

Tubes</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>(Bernoulli)</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Bernoulli's (ber-nool'-ee) principle, states
that as the velocity of fluid flow increases the pressure produced by
the fluid decreases. This can be shown by pulling and rotating a
cardboard tube rapidly through the air. The air next to the tube
changes its velocity relative to the tube wall due to the
spin.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In baseball the pitcher imparts different
spins on the ball to produce the curve on the trajectory of the ball
as it comes to the batter. They have names such as slider, curve down
and in, curve down and out, etc.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In golf, hitting a drive that actually climbs
as it leaves the club gives a greater distance and is a good analogy
to this demonstration. Golfers also draw and fade the ball with all
the clubs in order to play a shot to a certain landing
point.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>Materials</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Cardboard tube about 18 inches long (wrapping
paper tube will work) cloth or plastic tape about a meter long (a
measuring tape such as used in sewing works well) and a meter
stick.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>Instructions</B></FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><IMG SRC="Bernoulli5.gif" WIDTH=315 HEIGHT=171 BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom><br/>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">Find the center of mass of the tube and wrap the
tape measure around that point. Make a small loop in the other end of
the tape and fasten it with a piece of sticky tape. Put one end of
the meter stick through the loop, place the tube on a table and swing
the meter stick forward rapidly. The tube will spin and move forward,
moving upward in looping motion, see diagram.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>(Bernoulli)</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Most of the time when we blow towards a light
object it takes off in the direction of the moving blast of air. In
this demonstration that simple concept is turned inside out by the
Bernoulli principle. When air is moving it does not cause as much
pressure on the surfaces it&#146;s moving past as it would if it were
quiet. In addition, the faster the air moves the pressure on the
surfaces it&#146;s moving past is less and less .</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">When we use a vacuum cleaner we often talk
about the dirt being "sucked up" off the floor. It may not be
comfortable at first, but the idea of suction is a false concept
right from the start. There is no such thing as suction, just areas
of high pressure next to areas of lower pressure and the Bernoulli
effect. Students that write on the back of a desk that "...this class
sucks..." should not be taken very seriously because they have
learned little about the world. The vacuum cleaner creates high speed
air above the dirt, the pressure above the dirt drops due to the
Bernoulli effect and the air under the dirt pushes the dirt particles
up into the air stream. Most modern day vacuums have some method of
vibrating the carpet to make sure that the dirt has some air under it
to do the lifting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A common error made by people that carry
things in the back of an open pickup truck is to forget when you are
driving, fast air will rush across the top of your load. If your load
contains materials that are light, have large surface areas, and trap
quiet air under them you will get a large Bernoulli effect. The
mattress in the pickup bed is a common example. It fits down quite
well so we decide that the load is secure and away you go. Somewhere
down the road we are surprised to see the mattress lifting up out of
the box as if by magic!!!</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>Materials</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A thread spool, straight pin, and a small
piece of light cardboard.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>Instructions</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Push the pin through the center of the light
cardboard square and insert the free end of the pin into the empty
hole in the spool. The function of the pin is just to keep the
cardboard square centered on the end of the spool. Try to push the
cardboard off the by blowing air through the hole in the spool. The
harder you try the stronger the Bernoulli force created that holds it
in place. With practice you can actually prevent the cardboard from
falling out, in an upside down orientation, until you stop creating a
Bernoulli effect with your breath.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>(Bernoulli)</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Whenever a fluid (Fluids are essentially gases
and liquids) is moving faster than the fluid close to it, the faster
moving fluid will have a lower pressure. This, among other things, is
a very important concept in the flight of airplanes. In this
demonstration, you can show the difference between air pressure and
the force of air moving against something.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In a storm where the wind is blowing very
hard, the pressure of the air inside a house is higher than the
pressure of the air blowing across it. This can lift the roof off of
a house.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">If you are carrying a large sheet of plywood
in the bed of a pickup truck, you may very well want to watch it
carefully, since the air moving past the truck is at a lower pressure
than the air trapped under the plywood, and it could be raised up
high enough to catch in the wind and be blown away.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>Materials</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One Styrofoam ball about 2.5 inches in
diameter, plastic funnel with a top larger than 2.5 inches, some
flexible tubing to fit the small end of the funnel</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>Instructions</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Place the Styrofoam ball on a flat surface and
cover it with the large end of the funnel. While blowing into the
tube attached to the small end of the funnel, lift the funnel off the
flat surface. The Styrofoam ball will be lifted along with the funnel
as long as you continue blowing into the tube.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This effect is used by vacuum cleaner sales
people. A vacuum is set up to produce a blast of air in which a ball
is floated. This impossible looking situation attracts attention and
it can even be done at an angle. The ball will be located a little
below the center of the air blast in this circumstance. In this case
some Bernoulli effect works with the angled air blast to keep the
ball up against the pull of gravity.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>Materials</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Some device to produce a jet of air. Vacuum
cleaner, leaf blower, or maybe a school principal. Several light
balls of different size and weight.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>Instructions</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Direct the air blast in an upward direction
and place a ball in the air stream. You can tip the air blast to the
side and the ball should continue to float and stay approximately
centered. There is a limit to how far the system can be tipped to the
side.</FONT></P>

Bottles</B></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>(Bernoulli)</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This is another demonstration of
Bernoulli&#146;s Principle where an area of higher speed fluid is
used to lower the pressure and the visible movement of two plastic
pop bottles is used to show the results. Because empty</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">2-liter pop bottles are very light, they
require very little force to move them if you can reduce the friction
between them and the table. When you blow between the two bottles, it
would seem that they would move apart, away from the blast of air.
However, because of Bernoulli&#146;s Principle, the pressure between
the two bottles will be lower than the pressure on the outsides,
causing a net force to be exerted on each bottle toward the other.
Because you have reduced the friction between the bottles and the
table top, they can move toward each other easily, demonstrating the
force on each bottle towards the other. If the bottles don&#146;t
move on the first few tries direct the blast of air a little off the
center line between the two bottles and sooner or later they will
move easily together.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">You have probably heard that standing too
close to a railroad train as it passes can be dangerous. This is true
because a moving train drags the air close to the cars along with it.
This rapidly moving air, by Bernoulli&#146;s principle will have a
lower pressure than the still air a few feet away. The still air,
having higher pressure, and being behind you if you are standing
close will tend to push you toward the train. The effect is enough to
actually move a person if you are not careful!</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>Materials</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Two empty 2-liter plastic pop bottles, several

square.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Place the cardboard squares about four inches
apart on several straws set parallel to each other so that they can
roll along on the straws. Place the two bottles on the two squares of
cardboard. Direct a blast of air between the two bottles, and they
will move toward one another, actually hitting into each other. See
diagram.</FONT></P>
