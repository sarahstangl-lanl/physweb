<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">Transverse waves are waves
   that move along a medium where the medium moves perpendicular to
   the direction that the wave moves. </FONT>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">Water waves move in this manner.
   The wave moves across the water horizontally, but the water (the
   medium) actually moves up and down, perpendicular to the direction
   the wave moves.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">If you send a wave down a rope
   suspended between two people, the rope moves up and down, but the
   wave moves horizontally.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">If you lay a slinky on the floor
   and send a horizontal wave by moving one end of it back and forth
   horizontally, the wave moves from you to the other end, but the
   slinky moves back and forth, and returns to the same spot after
   the wave has passed.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">When Crazy George, the Vikings
   Cheerleader, sends a wave around the Metro dome, the people stand
   up and sit down as the wave moves horizontally and after the wave
   has passed they all remain in the same seat. </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">Start at one end of the row
   and have the first students stand up and sit down. All other
   student in the row must wait and respond when the wave gets to
   them. If students are to quick to respond have them hold hands and
   close their eyes in a practice run. If they are in a circle, it
   can continue around several times. If you have a video camera, you
   may want to record it and show them a recording of the
   action.</FONT>

 Wave - Compression</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">(Types of Waves)</FONT></P></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">A compression is
   characterized by having a particle in the medium move forward,
   bump into the next particle in the medium and then bounce back to
   its original position. This continues with each particle bumping
   its neighbor and then returning to its original position thereby
   transmitting the disturbance through the medium.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">A group of people seated
   side by side and shoulder to shoulder in a row. People on bleacher
   seats or in chairs placed next to each other are in the correct
   orientation for this demonstration.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>Instructions</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">Instruct a person on one
   side of the room to bend and gently bump shoulders with their
   neighbor and return to their normal position. The person bumped
   responds by bending to bump shoulders with the third person in
   line and so on. This shows the characteristics of a compression
   wave, (longitudinal wave). It is useful to illustrate the wave
   cannot be transmitted without a medium. To do this make a break
   between a couple of the people and show the wave cannot travel
   across the break because there is no medium, (people), to transmit
   the wave. It also shows the medium does not move forward, just the
   wave. Sound waves are an example of compression or longitudinal
   waves.</FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">When sound is sent off from
   a source the air wiggles a little, but does not go off producing a
   wind. </FONT>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">Sound can break a glass (it was
   shown on television in yet another ad for some recording device),
   but it does it with very small vibrations, not with a straight
   line wind.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">In an explosion there can be a
   powerful rush of air radiating out from the detonation site. This
   air motion is produced by the heating effects of the exploding
   materials and is not due to the sound that is
   generated.</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">A plastic bugle, bubble
   solution, and something to catch any drippings. A metal horn will
   work, but the soap bubble is harder to keep in tact. Bubble
   solution formula: Add one cup of Dawn detergent to one gallon of
   water. Add one tsp. of glycerine.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">Dip the end of the horn
   into the bubble solution. After you have a bubble across the bell
   of the horn blow a long and steady note. Start softly with little
   air to keep from breaking the bubble prematurely. The sound is
   heard by everyone in the room and yet the bubble is not broken.
   You can darken the room and shine a light on the bubble which will
   allow students to see the sound vibrations as they pass from the
   air in the bubble to the outside. If you can change notes from
   high to low frequency students can also make the connection
   between frequency a the pitch they hear. </FONT>

 and Anti-nodes (flexible hose)</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">(Standing Waves)</FONT></P></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">Any time you get waves from
   different sources to cross each other they will add together. This
   addition will produce places where the waves are large in size as
   well as places where the addition produces minimums, or even no
   wave. A simple way to see this is to send a series of waves down a
   rope, hose, or the like and let them reflect off the other end.
   The reflected waves that are returning act as a second source that
   will cross the newly generated incoming waves and wave
   interference results. If you play with the rhythm (frequency) that
   you produce, the waves will hit several situations where the quiet
   spots (nodes) and the large waving spots (anti-nodes) remain in
   fixed positions. This phenomenon is called a standing wave.</FONT>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">The production of standing waves
   is very important in the operation of musical instruments. The
   sound played on a string of a violin enters the wooden resonant
   chamber to establish a standing wave. The odd shape and size of
   the chamber allows for at least one dimension to establish a
   standing wave for every note the instrument can play. In just a
   few vibrations of the string the standing wave becomes large and
   strong able to produce full rich sound to be heard across the
   room. </FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">When we sing in the shower and
   our voice becomes full, powerful and rich on certain notes it's
   because the dimensions of the small room produces a standing wave.
   If you have a normal size bathroom this phenomenon is much more
   likely for deeper voice of men than women.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">On occasion you can see a
   standing wave in high line wires and in the radio antenna of cars.
   The high line wires establish a standing wave during wind storms.
   There is usually a node in the middle and two anti nodes nearer
   the poles. When cars with large engines idle, the vibrations of
   the motor can produce a standing wave in the radio antenna.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">Any rope, hose, or the like
   will work for this demonstration. However, the slower the waves
   move down the medium, the lower the frequency needed to produce an
   observable standing wave. A rubber hose filled with water works
   well.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>Instructions</B></FONT></P>

<& /mason/image.comp, filename=>'sound3.gif' &>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">Pull the hose somewhat
   tight and send single frequency waves down towards the fixed end.
   Don't get discouraged in the first few moments because waves must
   reach the other end and start to return before you can expect a
   standing wave to set up. You may have to adjust your frequency a
   little to establish a good standing wave. You can try circular
   waves as well. They are a little easier to produce at a constant
   frequency. Once you have a standing wave the energy you need to
   put in to keep it going is smaller than that needed to get things
   started.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="geneva,san-serif" COLOR="#000099">Hoot
 Tubes</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">(Standing Waves)</FONT></P></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">This demonstration
   illustrates the preference of a certain length column of air
   inside a hollow tube to choose a particular frequency of sound to
   amplify (resonate) by setting up a standing wave. This standing
   wave will have one half the wavelength of the frequency it is
   amplifying or a whole number of half wavelengths, depending on the
   energy of the source. (i.e. 1/2, 2/2, 3/2, etc.) When you light
   the burner, it heats up the burned gases and the air near the
   flame. This causes these gases to become less dense and they are
   pushed up by cooler, heavier gasses near by. As these gases move
   through the wire mesh turbulence is established producing many
   different frequencies of sound called white sound. We hear it as a
   hissing or slight roaring noise. When the tube is placed over this
   array of many frequencies it will, because of its length, pick out
   one of the frequencies and set up a standing wave in the tube.
   This amplifies that frequency dramatically, and we will hear the
   characteristic hoot. </FONT>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">This is really the principle used
   by any wind instruments in a band or orchestra. The instrument has
   a hollow tube of some sort, its length will determine which
   frequencies it will amplify and its shape will determine the
   quality or type of sound it will give out. The musician produces a
   vibration, usually with the lips or a reed, and the air in the
   hollow tube will vibrate in resonance with whatever frequency it
   is designed to amplify. </FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">The simplest and easiest to
   understand is the trombone. Notice that when a trombonist wants a
   lower note, she will move the slide to make the vibrating air
   column longer, and a higher note is achieved by moving the slide
   to make the vibrating air column shorter. There is also an
   interplay of the tightness of the embouchure to get other notes,
   but with a given tenseness given by the musician's lips, the
   length of the tube will then decide which note is
   sounded.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>Materials</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">A large hollow tube (center
   core of a carpet roll works well), a Fisher burner (or any other
   burner that has a wire mess to spread the flame), and a source of
   propane or natural gas to operate the burner. </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif"><B>Instructions</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">Light the burner and set it
   on the floor so that you can take the hollow tube and place its
   mouth over the burner. Move the tube slowly down toward the base
   of the burner until the tube begins to vibrate, resonating its
   characteristic frequency. It should be quite loud and a frequency
   that depends on the length of the tube. The tube is open and
   therefore will have an anti node at both ends. This allows only
   whole-number multiples of half wavelengths within the tube as
   illustrated below.</FONT>
   
<& /mason/image.comp, filename=>'sound4.gif' &>   
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">Each of the examples above would
   be consecutively higher notes, going from left to right. The one
   at the far left is considered the "fundamental" frequency of that
   tube of that particular length.</FONT></P>
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="geneva,san-serif">Use caution with the flame and
   the cardboard tube. Its a good idea to spray the inside of the
   tube with a fire retardant.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
