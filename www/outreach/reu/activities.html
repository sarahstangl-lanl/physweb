<h3>Seminars</h3>
<p>
During the first half of the program, faculty members offer presentations on their research 
activities to the REU group.  This is an excellent opportunity for the REU participants to 
learn about what is involved in conducting research in an academic environment.  Speakers 
from several physics subfields describe what they do in their labs and offices and detail 
their unique perspective on what it means to be a physicist.
<p>
During the second half of the program, in order to gain experience in presenting their research 
results (an essential aspect of conducting scientific research), participants have the opportunity 
to prepare and present a talk about their own research project to the REU group and select faculty.  
Students also prepare a written report describing their project and results.  </p>



<h3>Poster Session</h3>
<p>
At the end of the program, the participants present their research results at two poster 
sessions - one in the Physics department; the other in 
the Summer Undergraduate Research Expo. 
The Expo includes participants from the other REU programs within the 
University's College of Science and Engineering, as well as Twin Cities area representatives from industry.



<h3>Physics GRE Preparation</h3>
<p>
REU participants interested in reviewing for the Physics GRE are offered GRE preparation sessions.  
Informational sessions in general graduate school application and composition of personal statements 
may also be offered by the Graduate School's Summer Research Opportunities Program.

    <h3>Social Outings</h3>
A number of events are organized each summer for all REU programs University-wide. In the past, these events have included<br>
<ul>
<li>A University-wide orientation followed by bowling and pizza party at the student union</li>
<li>Special workshops</li>
<li>A Major League Baseball game at <a href="http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/min/ballpark/">Target Field</a></li>

<h3>Soudan Underground Mine </h3>
<p>
The MRSEC and Physics REU and RET programs have the opportunity to see an example of collaborative "big science" in this country one-half mile underground
at the site of the MINOS and CDMS II experiments. You can find out more information about the mine <a href="http://www.sudan.umn.edu/">here</a>
