<p>During the first month of the summer program, a faculty member shares his
research activities with the REU group.  This is an invaluable resource
for the students to discover what is involved carrying out research
in an academic environment.  Speakers from nearly every subfield in 
physics not only describe what they do in their labs and offices, but
also detail their unique perspectives on what it means to be physicists.</p>
<p>
Beginning the second month, the students themselves have the unique opportunity of preparing and presenting a talk about the research they are conducting.  These talks, presented to peers and select faculty, provide insight into an essential aspect of being an experimental physicist.  </p>
