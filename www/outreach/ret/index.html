<p>
Research Experience for Teachers (RET) is a six-week summer research program aimed at engaging 
K-12 physical sciences teachers in cutting-edge physics research and helping them translate their this experience and knowledge into classroom 
activities.  The goal is to help build ongoing collaborative partnerships between K-12 teachers and the University's research community. 
</p>
<p>
Program participants will work at the University's Twin Cities campus for six weeks in the physics 
research area of their choice. All participants receive a stipend for the six-week program that 
is based upon their academic year base salary.*   
<p>
Among the career development program activities are weekly physics seminars offered in conjunction with 
the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, a session on ethics in scientific research, and 
a weekly seminar with the Physics Education research group to discuss issues directly applicable to 
teaching. 
<p>
RET offers physics and physical science teachers:
                      
<p>
<ul><li>Hands-on experience in physics research techniques
<li>Information about cutting-edge experiments in physics
<li>A stipend equal to six weeks of base teaching salary
<li>Academic year follow-up
</ul>
<p>
Teachers selected for the program will be matched with faculty and research programs that most closely 
correspond to their interests.  Previous participants have conducted research in:
<p>
<ul><li>Biophysics
<li>Condensed Matter Physics
<li>High Energy Particle Physics
<li>Physics Education
<li>Space Physics
<li>Astrophysics and Cosmology
</ul>
<p>
*Stipend amount not to exceed NSF maximum of $10,000.
<p>
 <b>Applications will open November 15th, 2016 and will close at 11:59 p.m. on January 30th, 2017</b>
