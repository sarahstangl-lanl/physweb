<h4>2003 RET Program</h4>

Here are some brief descriptions of the activities (both in initiation to research and in curriculum development) undertaken by high-school physics teachers participating in the RET program in the summer of 2003.
<p>
<b>Kimberly Carlson</b> (Minnetonka High School) and Bonnie Hill (Osseo High School) collaborated with Prof. Heller and others within the Physics Education group in developing a rubric to judge student laboratory reports along the different axes typically used in evaluating technical writing.  Using an extensive computerized database of student lab reports, this work was reported at the national meeting of the AAPT in January 2004.

<b>Michael Maas</b> (Eden Prairie High School) worked with Prof. T. J. Jones (Astronomy) on the design of a CCD camera-based optical imaging polarimeter for the Mt. Lemmon Observatory 60-inch telescope, first using professional optical design software (Zemax) and later supervising (as well as participating in) the fabrication, assembly and testing of the final product.  This experience allowed the development of a teaching unit for high school astronomy using a CCD camera with a small telescope.

<b>Michael Nordstrand</b> (Pine City High School), in residence at the Soudan Underground Laboratory in northern Minnesota, worked with Prof. Peterson on the final checkout and repair of electronic systems and diagnostic equipment for the MINOS long-baseline neutrino oscillation search experiment.  He also contributed to the laboratory’s outreach mission by guiding tours of the facility for the general public, as well as preparing an introductory PowerPoint presentation of particle physics, appropriate for high school students.
<p>
<b>Shane Wood</b> (Irondale High School) worked with Prof. Rusack on an electronics test set-up for components of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector, itself under construction at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland) as an adjunct to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) scheduled for completion in 2007.   In addition, using materials from a variety of sources, he began the development of an introductory curriculum on particles and the universe for high school students.
