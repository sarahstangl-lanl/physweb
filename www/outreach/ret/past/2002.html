<%method title>2002 Summary of Research and Teaching Development Activities</%method>
<h4>2002 RET program</h4>


Here are some brief descriptions of the activities (both in initiation to research and in curriculum development) undertaken by high school physics teachers participating in the RET program in the Summer of 2002.
<p>

<b>Jon Anderson</b> (Centennial High School) worked with Prof. E. Peterson in the High Energy Physics Group. He assisted in development and testing of equipment for the detector fabrication facility, as well as other aspects of the project. He will be involved as part of a team of physicists, educators and Minnesota State Parks personnel who are developing a display facility to explain the MINOS project to the general public at the Soudan Mine State Park.

<b>David Brown</b> (Blaine High School) worked with Prof. J. Broadhurst to set up and repair an electron microscope for biophysics experiments.  He will incorporate his experience directly into his classroom teaching.
<p>
<b>Clark Erickson</b> (Eden Prairie High School) worked with Prof. P. Heller in the Physics Education group on the development of a new 8th / 9th grade Physical Sciences curriculum project supported by NSF.  Based on his experiences this summer he will incorporate his entire school (6 physical science teachers) in the initial classroom testing and modification process this year.
