<h4>Michael DuVernois</h4>
Michael works at the interface between particle physics and astrophysics. His research is focused on high-energy cosmic ray and neutrino physics. Experiments fly on stratospheric balloons or spacecrafts, are built in the Argentinian grasslands or deep underground in Northern Minnesota, and are launched from Antarctica or rural New Mexico. His group is also involved in detector development and the simulation of cosmic-ray propagation and air showers.

<h4>Shaul Hanany</h4>

Shaul studies the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, the uniform glow of microwave radiation that is a relic of the Big Bang. He builds instruments to detect small fluctuations in the radiation intensity across the sky. Most of his instruments are launched on stratospheric balloon borne platforms. His group is also involved in CMB data analysis activities.

<h4>Keith Olive</h4>
Keith works mostly with Big Bang nucleosynthesis, an explanation of the origin of light element isotopes through 7Li; particle dark matter; Big Bang baryogenesis, which explains the matter-antimatter asymmetry observed in nature; and inflation, a theory constructed to resolve many outstanding problems in standard cosmology.

<h4>Yong-Zhong Qian</h4>
Yong-Zhong's main interest is nuclear and particle astrophysics. He studies supernova explosions and the associated production of heavy elements where neutrinos play essential roles. A major goal of these studies is to use astrophysical processes to probe the particle properties of neutrinos, such as neutrino masses and the mixings between different neutrino flavors.
<p>
Neutrinos with a mass of a few eV are comologically interesting as they may constitute the hot dark matter relevant for large-scale structure formation in the universe. Neutrino flavor mixings may explain the puzzling experimental results for neutrinos from the sun and earth's atmosphere. There are also active and planned laboratory experiments searching for neutrino masses and flavor mixings.
<p>
Even more recently Yong-Zhong has become interested in the formation of the first stars and abundances at high red shifts. Both of these subjects are under active observational studies.
