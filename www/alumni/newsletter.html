 The School of Physics and Astronomy Newsletter informs alumni and friends about current events, awards, research trends and new faculty.
</p>

<p><!--For the next edition of the School of Physics and Astronomy alumni newsletter we will highlight our alumni who graduated in the 2000's.  Please send stories about your experiences in the School of Physics and Astronomy.  Tell us about your job(s), research, business endeavors, awards, patents, or simply that you are doing well.  We would like to hear about your personal life: your spouse; your children; your grandchildren; travel; significant birthdays; wedding anniversaries; or anything else you would like to share.  Send pictures!  We promise to scan the photos, and send the images back to you in good shape. Send your Class Note to <a href="mailto:alumni@physics.umn.edu">Alumni@physics.umn.edu</a></p>-->
