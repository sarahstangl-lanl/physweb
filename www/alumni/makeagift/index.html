<h4>Giving to the Department Through Your Estate</h4>

<p>
Supporting the School of Physics and Astronomy in your estate plan is a simple way to make a profound impact. Although there are
several ways to  make such a gift, one of the easiest is placing a bequest to the School in your will. This has the advantage
of not depleting needed income for living expenses, and often allows you to make a more financially significant gift than would
have been possible during life.
