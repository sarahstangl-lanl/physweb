We'd love to hear from you and so would your fellow alumni. <a href="mailto:alumni@physics.umn.edu">Send us</a> your news about your work, life milestones and we will post them here and in the newsletter.
<p>
<b>Stanley Brodsky</b> (B. S. '61, Ph.D Physics '64) is currently a Distinguished Fellow at Jefferson Laboratory, Newport News, Virginia during his sabbatical from the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, Stanford University.  
<p>
<b>Arnold Dahm</b> (Ph. D. '65) Would like to announce his promotion to Emeritus status after 33 years teaching at Case Western Reserve University. Dahm will continue doing full-time physics research with a major portion of his time spent doing background research necessary for realizing a quantum computer.  He and his wife, Susan have two daughters, one is an interior designer and theother works in art conservation at the Art Institute of Chicago.  Dahm's  hobbies remain skiing and tennis.

<&| feature.comp:feature, filename=>'Jaeger4web.jpg',alt=>'Heinrich Jaeger',credit=>'photo by Tom Foley',caption=>'Heinrich Jaeger, shortly after receiving the Outstanding Achievement award.'&><b>Heinrich Jaeger</b>, University of Chicago, was presented with the University of Minnesota Outstanding Achievement Award on February 20, 2002, at a special ceremony.  
<p>
Jaeger is a U of M physics alumnus (Ph.D. 1987, M.S. 1982) and was recognized for his scientific accomplishments in three research areas of condensed matter science: the study of granular media, vortex dynamics in superconductors, and mesoscopic physics.  Following the award ceremony,  Jaeger presented the Winifred B. and Henry A. Erikson Lecture on "Grains, Physics and the Art of Packing." </&>

<b> Dr. Nicholas Kraus </b> (Ph.D. 1972) was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Lund University in Sweden on June 1, 2001.  Kraus was cited for his contribution to coastal engineering and for numerical models of shoreline change and erosion, which he developed in collaboration with three doctoral students from Lund.  Dr. Kraus is currently a Senior Scientist at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory in Vicksburg, Mississippi.
