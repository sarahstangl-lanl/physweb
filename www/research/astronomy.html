<p>
         Research areas of the Astronomy Department at Minnesota include comets, star formation and stellar evolution, novae, supernova remnants, the interstellar medium and galactic structure, structure and evolution of galaxies, gravitational lensing and cosmology.  Instrumentation development in spectroscopy, photometry and polarimetry is concentrated in the infrared.  Theoretical and computational astrophysics deal with gas dynamics as well as visualization of 3-D astrophysical simulations.
<p>
         In addition to departmental telescopes at O'Brien and Mt. Lemmon, researchers use the national optical and infrared facilities at Kitt Peak, Cerro Tololo, Mauna Kea, the Hubble Space Telescope and the radio telescopes at Greenbank, Arecibo and the Very Large Array.   The Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) has significant departmental involvement.  The department is also expecting to join the Large Binocular Telescope project in Arizona and thereby obtain guaranteed access to an entire suite of optical telescopes from 0.9 to 8.4 meters in aperture as well as a 10 meter submillimeter radio telescope.
