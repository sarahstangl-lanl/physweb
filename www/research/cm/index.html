<h3>Physics of Matter</h3>

<p>
Condensed matter physics, and the closely associated discipline of
materials physics, are the largest subfields in physics. Condensed matter research at Minnesota spans a range that includes the strange properties of electricity at nanoscales, to activities that may truly be
considered "high science," understanding phenomena such as "superfluids," <sup>3</sup>He and <sup>4</sup>He. 
<p>
Condensed matter and materials physics have been the
sources of numerous technologies important to daily life.  These include
compound semiconductor electronics, magnetic and optical
storage systems, liquid crystal displays, and semiconductor lasers.
Among the many efforts at Minnesota aimed at future technology are the experiments in spintronics, which are attempting to solve problems associated with the coupling of a semiconductor and a ferromagnet.  Several of the condensed matter faculty members participate in the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, a collaborative effort by the University that crosses departmental boundaries.
<p>
The condensed matter group at Minnesota investigates a wide range of experimental and theoretical problems in superconductivity and superfluidity, magnetism, mesoscopic physics, liquid crystals, semiconductors, surface physics and complexity.
