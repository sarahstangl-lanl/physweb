<h3>Physics of Nuclear Matter</h3>
<p>
Nuclear theorists at the University of Minnesota seek to understand the
properties of dense matter under the conditions present in the early
universe, in stars, and during supernovae. Data from experiments which
collide nuclei at high energy, such as those at Brookhaven's Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and soon at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC),
can be compared to theoretical calculations and numerical simulations to
understand the dynamics of nuclear matter under extreme conditions.
Theoretical effort is directed at investigating the nature of these
interactions and their implications for understanding quantum
chromodynamics (QCD), particularly quark-gluon plasma. Another major
thrust is the study of supernova physics, including the explosion
mechanism, nucleosynthesis of medium and heavy elements, and neutrino
oscillation effects.

<p>
Professor Joseph Kapusta investigates matter at high energy-density.  He
uses relativistic quantum field theory to study high energy nuclear
collisions at RHIC and LHC, phase transitions in the early universe, dense
matter in neutron stars, primordial/microscopic black holes, Hawking
radiation, and the anti-de Sitter space conformal field theory
correspondence

<p>
Professor Yong-Zhong Qian has interests that lie at the intersection of
nuclear physics and astrophysics. He studies the detailed mechanism by
which the medium and heavy elements are formed in stars and in stellar
explosions.  He also studies neutrinos, their oscillations, and the role
they play in supernovae.

<p>
Professor Alexander Heger studies the life and explosive death of massive
stars and the origin of the elements, and is generally interested in nuclear
astrophysics. His work comprises the study of massive and very
massive stars (10-1000 solar masses); the first generations of stars in the
universe (Pop III stars); evolution of rotating massive stars and the spin
of their remnants; mixing and transport processes in the stellar interior;
nucleosynthesis and the origin of elements, including galacto-chemical evolution -
which elements are made where and when; supernovae (mechanisms and nucleosynthesis);
gamma-ray bursts (collapsars and similar models) and their progenitors;
modeling of Type I X-ray bursts and superbursts (thermonuclear explosions
on the surface of neutron stars). Heger likes to say, "I blow up stars for a living."
