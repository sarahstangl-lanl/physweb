The workshop is designed primarily for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in the biological sciences. Non-biologists with an interest in fluorescence are welcome to apply as well.

<p>
      
Fluorescence microscopy has undergone a renaissance in the last decade. The introduction of green fluorescent protein (GFP) together with the development of novel techniques, such as confocal and two-photon detection, made it possible to study protein interactions directly in living cells and to examine the structure and function of living tissue. The impact of these and other methods in biophysics, neuroscience, and developmental and cell biology has been remarkable. Further development in fluorophore design and microscopy are poised to profoundly transform many fields of biological research. With these changes an increasing number of students will encounter fluorescence techniques as part of their thesis research or at a later stage in their career. 
<p>
Despite the growing importance of fluorescence the vast majority of students in the biological sciences have not received training in the principles of fluorescence spectroscopy.  As a result, students often have misconceptions and overlook important aspects of the technique when performing fluorescence experiments. The goal of the workshop is to equip students with the knowledge needed to successfully perform fluorescence experiments. The workshop includes morning lectures and afternoon hands-on training on fluorescence instrumentation. The course starts by introducing students to the fundamental concepts of fluorescence and ends with a discussion of advanced microscopy techniques.
