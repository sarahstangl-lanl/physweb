This workshop is part of my CAREER award (PHY-0346782) by the National Science Foundation. Many people helped in getting this workshop of the ground. I am especially indebted to Dave Jameson, Theodore “Chip” Hazlett, Enrico Gratton, and Bob Clegg for providing me with a lot of material for preparing the lectures. Special thanks also to Sergey Tetin from Abbott Laboratories who generously donated antibodies, and to Jenny Allan and Shelley Franklin for help with the organization of the workshop. And last but not least I appreciate the hard work of my students Bin and Joe in setting up the lab experiments.
