=head1 NAME

Astro::Coord::ECI::Sun - Compute the position of the Sun.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Astro::Coord::ECI;
 use Astro::Coord::ECI::Sun;
 use Astro::Coord::ECI::Utils qw{deg2rad};
 
 # 1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington DC USA
 # latitude 38.899 N, longitude 77.038 W,
 # altitude 16.68 meters above sea level
 my $lat = deg2rad (38.899);    # Radians
 my $long = deg2rad (-77.038);  # Radians
 my $alt = 16.68 / 1000;        # Kilometers
 my $sun = Astro::Coord::ECI::Sun->new ();
 my $sta = Astro::Coord::ECI->
     universal (time ())->
     geodetic ($lat, $long, $alt);
 my ($time, $rise) = $sta->next_elevation ($sun);
 print "Sun @{[$rise ? 'rise' : 'set']} is ",
     scalar gmtime $time, " UT\n";

Although this example computes the Sun rise or set in Washington D.C.
USA, the time is displayed in Universal Time. This is because I did not
want to complicate the example by adding machinery to convert the time
to the correct zone for Washington D.C. (which is UT - 5 except when
Summer Time is in effect, when it is UT - 4).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements the position of the Sun as a function of time, as
described in Jean Meeus' "Astronomical Algorithms," second edition. It
is a subclass of B<Astro::Coord::ECI>, with the id, name, and diameter
attributes initialized appropriately, and the time_set() method
overridden to compute the position of the Sun at the given time.


=head2 Methods

The following methods should be considered public:

=over

=cut

package Astro::Coord::ECI::Sun;

use strict;
use warnings;

our $VERSION = '0.051';

use base qw{Astro::Coord::ECI};

use Astro::Coord::ECI::Utils qw{:all};
use Carp;
use POSIX qw{floor strftime};

my %static = (
    id => 'Sun',
    name => 'Sun',
    diameter => 1392000,
    );

my $weaken = eval {
    require Scalar::Util;
    Scalar::Util->can('weaken');
};
my $object;

our $Singleton = $weaken;

=item $sun = Astro::Coord::ECI::Sun->new();

This method instantiates an object to represent the coordinates of the
Sun. This is a subclass of B<Astro::Coord::ECI>, with the id and name
attributes set to 'Sun', and the diameter attribute set to 1392000 km
per Jean Meeus' "Astronomical Algorithms", 2nd Edition, Appendix I,
page 407.

Any arguments are passed to the set() method once the object has been
instantiated. Yes, you can override the "hard-wired" id, name, and so
forth in this way.

If $Astro::Coord::ECI::Sun::Singleton is true, you get a singleton
object; that is, only one object is instantiated and subsequent calls
to new() just return that object. This only works if Scalar::Util
exports weaken(). If it does not, the setting of
$Astro::Coord::ECI::Sun::Singleton is silently ignored. The default
is true if Scalar::Util can be loaded and exports weaken(), and false
otherwise.

=cut

sub new {
    my ($class, @args) = @_;
    ref $class and $class = ref $class;
    if ( $Singleton && $weaken && __classisa( $class, __PACKAGE__ ) ) {
	if ($object) {
	    $object->set (@args) if @args;
	    return $object;
	} else {
	    my $self = $object = $class->SUPER::new (%static, @args);
	    $weaken->($object);
	    return $self;
	}
    } else {
	return $class->SUPER::new (%static, @args);
    }
}


=item @almanac = $sun->almanac( $location, $start, $end );

This method produces almanac data for the Sun for the given location,
between the given start and end times. The location is assumed to be
Earth-Fixed - that is, you can't do this for something in orbit.

The C<$location> argument may be omitted if the C<station> attribute has
been set. That is, this method can also be called as

 @almanac = $sun->almanac( $start, $end )

The start time defaults to the current time setting of the $sun
object, and the end time defaults to a day after the start time.

The almanac data consists of a list of list references. Each list
reference points to a list containing the following elements:

 [0] => time
 [1] => event (string)
 [2] => detail (integer)
 [3] => description (string)

The @almanac list is returned sorted by time.

The following events, details, and descriptions are at least
potentially returned:

 horizon: 0 = Sunset, 1 = Sunrise;
 transit: 0 = local midnight, 1 = local noon;
 twilight: 0 = end twilight, 1 = begin twilight;
 quarter: 0 = spring equinox, 1 = summer solstice,
          2 = fall equinox, 3 = winter solstice.

Twilight is calculated based on the current value of the twilight
attribute of the $sun object. This attribute is inherited from
L<Astro::Coord::ECI|Astro::Coord::ECI>, and documented there.

=cut

sub __almanac_event_type_iterator {
    my ( $self, $station ) = @_;

    my $inx = 0;

    my @events = (
	[ $station, next_elevation => [ $self, 0, 1 ], 'horizon',
		[ 'Sunset', 'Sunrise' ] ],
	[ $station, next_meridian => [ $self ], 'transit',
		[ 'local midnight', 'local noon' ] ],
	[ $station, next_elevation =>
	    [ $self, $self->get( 'twilight' ), 0 ],
		'twilight', ['end twilight', 'begin twilight'] ],
	[ $self, next_quarter => [], 'quarter', '__quarter_name', ],
    );

    return sub {
	$inx < @events
	    and return @{ $events[$inx++] };
	return;
    };
}

use Astro::Coord::ECI::Mixin qw{ almanac };

=item @almanac = $sun->almanac_hash( $location, $start, $end );

This convenience method wraps $sun->almanac(), but returns a list of
hash references, sort of like Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE->pass()
does. The hashes contain the following keys:

  {almanac} => {
    {event} => the event type;
    {detail} => the event detail (typically 0 or 1);
    {description} => the event description;
  }
  {body} => the original object ($sun);
  {station} => the observing station;
  {time} => the time the quarter occurred.

The {time}, {event}, {detail}, and {description} keys correspond to
elements 0 through 3 of the list returned by almanac().

=cut

use Astro::Coord::ECI::Mixin qw{ almanac_hash };

=item $elevation = $tle->correct_for_refraction( $elevation )

This override of the superclass' method simply returns the elevation
passed to it. I have no algorithm for refraction at the surface of the
photosphere or anywhere else in the environs of the Sun, and explaining
why I make no correction at all seemed easier than explaining why I make
an incorrect correction.

See the L<Astro::Coord::ECI|Astro::Coord::ECI> C<azel()> and
C<azel_offset()> documentation for whether this class'
C<correct_for_refraction()> method is actually called by those methods.

=cut

sub correct_for_refraction {
    my ( $self, $elevation ) = @_;
    return $elevation;
}


=item $long = $sun->geometric_longitude ()

This method returns the geometric longitude of the Sun in radians at
the last time set.

=cut

sub geometric_longitude {
    my $self = shift;
    croak <<eod unless defined $self->{_sun_geometric_longitude};
Error - You must set the time of the Sun object before the geometric
        longitude can be returned.
eod

    return $self->{_sun_geometric_longitude};
}


=item ($point, $intens, $central) = magnitude ($theta, $omega);

This method returns the magnitude of the Sun at a point $theta radians
from the center of its disk, given that the disk's angular radius
(B<not> diameter) is $omega radians. The returned $point is the
magnitude at the given point (undef if $theta > $omega), $intens is the
ratio of the intensity at the given point to the central intensity (0
if $theta > $omega), and $central is the central magnitude.

If this method is called in scalar context, it returns $point, the point
magnitude.

If the $omega argument is omitted or undefined, it is calculated based
on the geocentric range to the Sun at the current time setting of the
object.

If the $theta argument is omitted or undefined, the method returns
the average magnitude of the Sun, which is taken to be -26.8.

The limb-darkening algorithm and the associated constants come from
L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_darkening>.

=cut

{	# Begin local symbol block

    my $central_mag;
    my @limb_darkening = (.3, .93, -.23);
    my $mean_mag = -26.8;

    sub magnitude {
	my ($self, $theta, $omega) = @_;
	return $mean_mag unless defined $theta;
	unless (defined $omega) {
	    my @eci = $self->eci ();
	    $omega = $self->get ('diameter') / 2 /
		sqrt (distsq (\@eci[0 .. 2], [0, 0, 0]));
	}
	unless (defined $central_mag) {
	    my $sum = 0;
	    my $quotient = 2;
	    foreach my $a (@limb_darkening) {
		$sum += $a / $quotient++;
	    }
	    $central_mag = $mean_mag - intensity_to_magnitude (2 * $sum);
	}
	my $intens = 0;
	my $point;
	if ($theta < $omega) {
	    my $costheta = cos ($theta);
	    my $cosomega = cos ($omega);
	    my $sinomega = sin ($omega);
	    my $cospsi = sqrt ($costheta * $costheta -
		    $cosomega * $cosomega) / $sinomega;
	    my $psiterm = 1;
	    foreach my $a (@limb_darkening) {
		$intens += $a * $psiterm;
		$psiterm *= $cospsi;
	    }
	    $point = $central_mag + intensity_to_magnitude ($intens);
	}
	return wantarray ? ($point, $intens, $central_mag) : $point;
    }
}	# End local symbol block.

=item ($time, $quarter, $desc) = $sun->next_quarter($want);

This method calculates the time of the next equinox or solstice
after the current time setting of the $sun object. The return is the
time, which equinox or solstice it is as a number from 0 (vernal
equinox) to 3 (winter solstice), and a string describing the equinox
or solstice. If called in scalar context, you just get the time.

The optional $want argument says which equinox or solstice you want.

As a side effect, the time of the $sun object ends up set to the
returned time.

The method of calculation is successive approximation, and actually
returns the second B<after> the calculated equinox or solstice.

Since we only calculate the Sun's position to the nearest 0.01 degree,
the calculated solstice or equinox may be in error by as much as 15
minutes.

=cut

use constant NEXT_QUARTER_INCREMENT => 86400 * 85;	# 85 days.

*__next_quarter_coordinate = __PACKAGE__->can( 
    'ecliptic_longitude' );

use Astro::Coord::ECI::Mixin qw{ next_quarter };

=item $hash_reference = $sun->next_quarter_hash($want);

This convenience method wraps $sun->next_quarter(), but returns the
data in a hash reference, sort of like Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE->pass()
does. The hash contains the following keys:

  {body} => the original object ($sun);
  {almanac} => {
    {event} => 'quarter',
    {detail} => the quarter number (0 through 3);
    {description} => the quarter description;
  }
  {time} => the time the quarter occurred.

The {time}, {detail}, and {description} keys correspond to elements 0
through 2 of the list returned by next_quarter().

=cut

use Astro::Coord::ECI::Mixin qw{ next_quarter_hash };

=item $period = $sun->period ()

Although this method is attached to an object that represents the
Sun, what it actually returns is the sidereal period of the Earth,
per Appendix I (pg 408) of Jean Meeus' "Astronomical Algorithms,"
2nd edition.

=cut

sub period {return 31558149.7632}	# 365.256363 * 86400

{

    my @quarters = ('Spring equinox', 'Summer solstice',
	'Fall equinox', 'Winter solstice');

    sub __quarter_name {
	my ( $self, $quarter ) = @_;
	return $quarters[$quarter];
    }
}

=item $sun->time_set ()

This method sets coordinates of the object to the coordinates of the
Sun at the object's currently-set universal time.  The velocity
components are arbitrarily set to 0. The 'equinox_dynamical' attribute
is set to the object's currently-set dynamical time.

Although there's no reason this method can't be called directly, it
exists to take advantage of the hook in the B<Astro::Coord::ECI>
object, to allow the position of the Sun to be computed when the
object's time is set.

The algorithm comes from Jean Meeus' "Astronomical Algorithms", 2nd
Edition, Chapter 25, pages 163ff.
